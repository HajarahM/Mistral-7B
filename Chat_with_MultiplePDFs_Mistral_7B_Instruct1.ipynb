Waiver of right to object.\\n\\nA party who knows of any provision of this Act from which the parties may\\n\\nderogate or of any requirement under the arbitration agreement which has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his or her objection to the noncompliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is prescribed, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived the right to object.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStay of legal proceedings.\\n\\n(1) A judge or magistrate before whom proceedings are being brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so applies after the filing of a statement of defence and both parties having been given a hearing, refer the matter back to the arbitration unless he or she finds—\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthat the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed; or that there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matters agreed to be referred to arbitration.\\n\\n(2) Notwithstanding that an application has been brought under subsection (1) and the matter is pending before the court, arbitral proceedings may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award may be made.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nInterim measures by the court.\\n\\n(1) A party to an arbitration agreement may apply to the court, before or during arbitral proceedings, for an interim measure of protection, and the court may grant that measure.\\n\\n(2) Where a party applies to the court for an injunction or other interim order and the arbitral tribunal has already ruled on any matter relevant to the application, the court shall treat the ruling or any finding of fact made in the course of the ruling as conclusive for the purposes of the application.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nDeath of a party.\\n\\n(1) An arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of any party to the agreement, either as respects the deceased or any other party, but in that event the agreement is enforceable by or against the personal representative of the deceased.\\n\\n(2) The authority of an arbitrator is not revoked by the death of any\\n\\nparty by whom he or she was appointed.\\n\\n(3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of any law by virtue\\n\\nof which any right of action is extinguished by the death of a person.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nReceipt of written communications.\\n\\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties— (a)\\n\\nany written communication is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence or mailing address; and the communication is deemed to have been received on the day it is so delivered.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nIf none of the places referred to in subsection (1)(a) can be found after making a reasonable inquiry, a written communication is deemed to have been received if it is sent to the addressee’s last known place of business, habitual residence or mailing address by registered mail or by any other means which provides a record of the attempt to deliver it.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3) This section does not apply to written communications in respect\\n\\nof court proceedings.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nExtent of court intervention.\\n\\nExcept as provided in this Act, no court shall intervene in matters governed by this Act.\\n\\n10. Determination of number of arbitrators.\\n\\n(1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIf the parties fail to determine the number of arbitrators under\\n\\nsubsection (1), there shall be one arbitrator.\\n\\n11. Appointment of arbitrators.\\n\\n(1) No person shall be precluded by reason of that person’s nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\\n\\n(2) The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the\\n\\narbitrator or arbitrators and if there is no agreement—\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nin an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; in an arbitration with one arbitrator, the parties shall agree on the person to be appointed.\\n\\n(3) Where— (a)\\n\\nin the case of three arbitrators, a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within thirty days after receipt of a request to do so from the other party or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days after their appointment; or in the case of one arbitrator, the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator,\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe appointment shall be made, upon application of a party, by the appointing authority.\\n\\n(4) Where, under a procedure agreed upon by the parties for the\\n\\nappointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators—\\n\\n(a) (b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\na party fails to act as required under that procedure; the parties or two arbitrators fail to reach the agreement expected of them under that procedure; or a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under that procedure,\\n\\nany party may apply to the appointing authority to take the necessary measures, unless the agreement otherwise provides, for securing compliance with the procedure agreed upon by the parties.\\n\\n(5) A decision of the appointing authority in respect of a matter under\\n\\nsubsection (3) or (4) shall be final and not be subject to appeal.\\n\\n(6) The appointing authority in appointing an arbitrator shall have due regard to any qualifications required of an arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\\n\\n12. Grounds for challenge.\\n\\n(1) When a person is approached in connection with his or her\\n\\npossible appointment as an arbitrator, he or she shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence.\\n\\n(2) An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality and independence, or if he or she does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties.\\n\\n(3) A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him or her, or in whose appointment that party has participated, only for reasons of which he or she becomes aware after the appointment.\\n\\n13. Challenge procedure.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIn this section, the parties are free to agree on a procedure for\\n\\nchallenging an arbitrator.\\n\\nIf there is no agreement under subsection (1), a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the composition of the appointing authority or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in section 12(2) send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the appointing authority; and unless the arbitrator who is being challenged withdraws from his or her office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the appointing authority shall decide on the challenge within a period of thirty days from receipt of a written statement.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n14. Failure or impossibility to act.\\n\\n(1) The mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate if— (a)\\n\\nhe or she, according to the parties, is unable to perform the functions of his or her office or for any reason fails to act without undue delay; he or she withdraws from his or her office; or he or she dies.\\n\\n(b) (c)\\n\\nIf there is any dispute concerning any of the grounds referred to in subsection (1)(a), a party may apply to the centre to decide on the termination of the mandate.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3) A decision of the centre under subsection (2) shall be final and\\n\\nshall not be subject to appeal.\\n\\n15. Termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator.\\n\\n(1) Where the mandate of an arbitrator is terminated under section 13 or 14, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedure that was applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.\\n\\n(2) Unless agreed by the parties— (a) where a sole arbitrator or the presiding arbitrator is replaced, any\\n\\nhearing previously held shall be held afresh; and\\n\\n(b) where an arbitrator, other than a sole arbitrator or a presiding arbitrator, is replaced, any hearings previously held may be held afresh at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n(3) Unless agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made before the replacement of an arbitrator under this section shall not be invalidated solely because there has been a change in the composition of the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.\\n\\n(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, and for that purpose—\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nan arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not itself invalidate the arbitration clause.\\n\\n(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; but a party is not precluded from raising such a plea because he or she has appointed or participated in the appointment of an arbitrator.\\n\\n(3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.\\n\\n(4) The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in\\n\\nsubsection (2) or (3), admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.\\n\\n(5) The arbitral tribunal shall rule on a plea referred to in subsections\\n\\n(2) and (3) as a preliminary question.\\n\\n(6) Where the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party aggrieved by the ruling may apply to the court, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, to decide the matter.\\n\\n(7) The decision of the court shall be final and shall not be subject to\\n\\nappeal.\\n\\n(8) While an application under subsection (6) is pending before the court, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award.\\n\\n17. Power of arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n(1) Unless the parties agree, the appointing authority may, at the request of a party, order any party to take such interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject matter of the dispute, and the arbitral tribunal may require any party to provide appropriate security in connection with such measure.\\n\\n(2) The appointing authority or a party with the approval of the appointing authority may seek assistance from the centre in the exercise of any power conferred on the appointing authority under subsection (1).\\n\\nIf a request is made under subsection (2), the court shall have, for the purposes of the arbitral proceedings, the same power to make an order for the doing of anything which the arbitral tribunal is empowered to order under subsection (1) as it would have in civil proceedings before that court, but the arbitral proceedings shall continue notwithstanding that a request has been made and is being considered by the court.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n18. Equal treatment of parties.\\n\\nThe parties shall be treated with equality, and each party shall be given reasonable opportunity for presenting his or her case.\\n\\n19. Determination of rules of procedure.\\n\\nSubject to this Act, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by rules of the arbitral tribunal in the conduct of the proceedings.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIf there is no agreement under subsection (1), the arbitral tribunal may, subject to this Act, conduct the arbitration in the manner it considers appropriate.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3) The power of the arbitral tribunal under subsection (2) includes the power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.\\n\\n(4) Every witness giving evidence and every person appearing before an arbitral tribunal shall have at least the same privileges and immunities as witnesses and advocates in proceedings before a court.\\n\\n20.

Guiding principles for mediators. A mediator shall strive to facilitate and control the process of mediation while encouraging and assisting the parties—\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nto reach a settlement;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nto appreciate the mediation process;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nto understand the rules to be followed during the mediation process;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nto understand the role of the mediator, the parties and others who attend mediation;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nto actively participate in the mediation process;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nto clarify and define the issues to be mediated;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nto determine whether and how to resolve their dispute;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nto identify what information and documents would help to resolve the dispute and how best such documents can be obtained;\\n\\n513\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nto communicate and negotiate fairly and in good faith all the parties to the mediation; to convey their interests to one another and explore possible settlement options;\\n\\n(k)\\n\\nto consider the risks and the strengths and weaknesses of their case;\\n\\n(l)\\n\\nto reach an informed decision about the dispute;\\n\\n(m) to produce a written report on the outcome of the mediation session;\\n\\nand\\n\\n(n) to prepare or assist in the preparation of an agreement where the\\n\\nparties have settled the dispute.\\n\\n3. Fairness and impartiality of mediator.\\n\\n(1) The mediator must endeavour to act fairly towards the parties in the\\n\\nmediation.\\n\\n(2) A mediator must be impartial and must not have any bias in favour of\\n\\nany party or discriminate against any party.\\n\\n(3) Where the mediator believes that one party is abusing the mediation process or that there is a power imbalance which may affect the possibility of a mutually acceptable resolution, it is the mediator’s responsibility to try and balance the power and ensure that the process is conducted fairly.\\n\\n4. Conflict of interest.\\n\\n(1) A mediator shall disclose to the parties to the mediation any matter\\n\\nwhich could be regarded as a conflict of interest.\\n\\n(2) The mediator shall disclose the conflict of interest as soon as the\\n\\nconflict of interest arises which could be prior to or during the mediation.\\n\\n(3) A conflict of interest may be apparent, potential or actual.\\n\\n(4) A mediator shall not act or continue to act in mediation where he or she has a conflict of interest unless all the parties specifically acknowledge the\\n\\n514\\n\\ndisclosure and agree in writing to the mediator acting or continuing to act as mediator. 5. A mediator must refrain from giving legal advice or counseling during the mediation process.\\n\\nSeparation of mediation from legal advice and counseling.\\n\\n6. Behavior of mediator.\\n\\n(1) A mediator shall always conduct himself or herself in a manner so as\\n\\nto reflect credit to the court.\\n\\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subrule (1) a mediator must—\\n\\n(a) act within the law and uphold the law;\\n\\n(b) act honestly, professionally and with integrity;\\n\\n(c) not abuse his or her position or connection with the court;\\n\\n(d) conduct himself or herself in a manner that promotes diligence,\\n\\ntimeliness and mutual respect among the participants;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nrespect the parties during mediation;\\n\\n(f) present himself or herself in appropriate formal attire;\\n\\n(g) not act outside his or her level of competence;\\n\\n(h) maintain his or her professional competence and skill by continuing\\n\\nto educate themselves on the mediation process; and\\n\\n(i)\\n\\navoid any appearance of disagreement with or criticism of a fellow mediator to the public.\\n\\n515\\n\\nCross References\\n\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap.4 Children Act, Cap 59 Judicature Act, Cap. 13 Judicature (Small Claims Procedure) Rules, 2011, SI No. 25 of 2011\\n\\nB.

III. 3 Ibid., annex I.\\n\\n2\\n\\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\\n\\n(as revised in 2010)\\n\\nSection I. Introductory rules\\n\\nScope of application*\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\n1. Where parties have agreed that disputes between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, shall be referred to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, then such disputes shall be settled in accordance with these Rules subject to such modification as the parties may agree.\\n\\n2. The parties to an arbitration agreement concluded after 15 August 2010 shall be presumed to have referred to the Rules in effect on the date of commencement of the arbitration, unless the parties have agreed to apply a particular version of the Rules. That presumption does not apply where the arbitration agree- ment has been concluded by accepting after 15 August 2010 an offer made before that date.\\n\\n3. These Rules shall govern the arbitration except that where any of these Rules is in conflict with a provision of the law applicable to the arbitration from which the parties cannot derogate, that provision shall prevail.\\n\\nNotice and calculation of periods of time\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\n1. A notice, including a notification, communication or proposal, may be transmitted by any means of communication that provides or allows for a record of its transmission.\\n\\nIf an address has been designated by a party specifically for 2. this purpose or authorized by the arbitral tribunal, any notice shall be delivered to that party at that address, and if so delivered shall\\n\\nA model arbitration clause for contracts can be found in the annex to the\\n\\nRules.\\n\\n3\\n\\nbe deemed to have been received. Delivery by electronic means such as facsimile or e-mail may only be made to an address so designated or authorized.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIn the absence of such designation or authorization, a notice is:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nReceived if it is physically delivered to the addressee; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nDeemed to have been received if it is delivered at the place of business, habitual residence or mailing address of the addressee.\\n\\n4. If, after reasonable efforts, delivery cannot be effected in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3, a notice is deemed to have been received if it is sent to the addressee’s last-known place of business, habitual residence or mailing address by registered letter or any other means that provides a record of delivery or of attempted delivery.\\n\\n5. A notice shall be deemed to have been received on the day it is delivered in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 or 4, or attempted to be delivered in accordance with paragraph 4. A notice transmitted by electronic means is deemed to have been received on the day it is sent, except that a notice of arbitration so transmitted is only deemed to have been received on the day when it reaches the addressee’s electronic address.\\n\\n6. For the purpose of calculating a period of time under these Rules, such period shall begin to run on the day following the day when a notice is received. If the last day of such period is an official holiday or a non-business day at the residence or place of business of the addressee, the period is extended until the first business day which follows. Official holidays or non- business days occurring during the running of the period of time are included in calculating the period.\\n\\nNotice of arbitration\\n\\nArticle 3\\n\\n1. The party or parties initiating recourse to arbitration (herein after called the “claimant”) shall communicate to the other party or parties (hereinafter called the “respondent”) a notice of arbitration.\\n\\n2. Arbitral proceedings shall be deemed to commence on the date on which the notice of arbitration is received by the respondent.\\n\\n4\\n\\n3. The notice of arbitration shall include the following:\\n\\n(a) A demand that the dispute be referred to arbitration;\\n\\n(b) The names and contact details of the parties;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nIdentification of the arbitration agreement that is invoked;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nIdentification of any contract or other legal instrument out of or in relation to which the dispute arises or, in the absence of such contract or instrument, a brief description of the relevant relationship;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nA brief description of the claim and an indication of the amount involved, if any;\\n\\n(f) The relief or remedy sought;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nA proposal as to the number of arbitrators, language and place of arbitration, if the parties have not previously agreed thereon.\\n\\n4. The notice of arbitration may also include:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nA proposal for the designation of an appointing authority referred to in article 6, paragraph 1;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nA proposal for the appointment of a sole arbitrator referred to in article 8, paragraph 1;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nNotification of the appointment of an arbitrator referred to in article 9 or 10.\\n\\n5. The constitution of the arbitral tribunal shall not be hindered by any controversy with respect to the sufficiency of the notice of arbitration, which shall be finally resolved by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nResponse to the notice of arbitration\\n\\nArticle 4\\n\\n1. Within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of arbitration, the respondent shall communicate to the claimant a response to the notice of arbitration, which shall include: (a) The name and contact details of each respondent;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nA response to the information set forth in the notice of arbitration, pursuant to article 3, paragraphs 3 (c) to (g).\\n\\n2. The response to the notice of arbitration may also include:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nAny plea that an arbitral tribunal to be constituted under these Rules lacks jurisdiction;\\n\\n5\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nA proposal for the designation of an appointing authority referred to in article 6, paragraph 1;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nA proposal for the appointment of a sole arbitrator referred to in article 8, paragraph 1;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nNotification of the appointment of an arbitrator referred to in article 9 or 10;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nA brief description of counterclaims or claims for the purpose of a set-off, if any, including where relevant, an indication of the amounts involved, and the relief or remedy sought;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nA notice of arbitration in accordance with article 3 in case the respondent formulates a claim against a party to the arbitration agreement other than the claimant.\\n\\n3. The constitution of the arbitral tribunal shall not be hindered by any controversy with respect to the respondent’s failure to communicate a response to the notice of arbitration, or an incomplete or late response to the notice of arbitration, which shall be finally resolved by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nRepresentation and assistance\\n\\nArticle 5\\n\\nEach party may be represented or assisted by persons chosen by it. The names and addresses of such persons must be communicated to all parties and to the arbitral tribunal. Such communication must specify whether the appointment is being made for purposes of representation or assistance. Where a person is to act as a representative of a party, the arbitral tribunal, on its own initiative or at the request of any party, may at any time require proof of authority granted to the representative in such a form as the arbitral tribunal may determine.\\n\\nDesignating and appointing authorities\\n\\nArticle 6\\n\\n1. Unless the parties have already agreed on the choice of an appointing authority, a party may at any time propose the name or names of one or more institutions or persons, including the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague (hereinafter called the “PCA”), one of whom would serve as appointing authority. If all parties have not agreed on the choice of an appointing 2. authority within 30 days after a proposal made in accordance\\n\\n6\\n\\nwith paragraph 1 has been received by all other parties, any party may request the Secretary-General of the PCA to designate the appointing authority.\\n\\n3. Where these Rules provide for a period of time within which a party must refer a matter to an appointing authority and no appointing authority has been agreed on or designated, the period is suspended from the date on which a party initiates the procedure for agreeing on or designating an appointing authority until the date of such agreement or designation.\\n\\n4. Except as referred to in article 41, paragraph 4, if the appointing authority refuses to act, or if it fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after it receives a party’s request to do so, fails to act within any other period provided by these Rules, or fails to decide on a challenge to an arbitrator within a reasonable time after receiving a party’s request to do so, any party may request the Secretary- General of the PCA to designate a substitute appointing authority.\\n\\nIn exercising their functions under these Rules, the appointing 5. authority and the Secretary-General of the PCA may require from any party and the arbitrators the information they deem necessary and they shall give the parties and, where appropriate, the arbitrators, an opportunity to present their views in any manner they consider appropriate. All such communications to and from the appointing authority and the Secretary-General of the PCA shall also be provided by the sender to all other parties.\\n\\n6. When the appointing authority is requested to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to articles 8, 9, 10 or 14, the party making the request shall send to the appointing authority copies of the notice of arbitration and, if it exists, any response to the notice of arbitration.\\n\\n7. The appointing authority shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and shall take into account the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties.\\n\\n7\\n\\nSection II. Composition of the arbitral tribunal\\n\\nNumber of arbitrators\\n\\nArticle 7\\n\\n1. If the parties have not previously agreed on the number of arbitrators, and if within 30 days after the receipt by the respondent of the notice of arbitration the parties have not agreed that there shall be only one arbitrator, three arbitrators shall be appointed.\\n\\n2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if no other parties have responded to a party’s proposal to appoint a sole arbitrator within the time limit provided for in paragraph 1 and the party or parties concerned have failed to appoint a second arbitrator in accordance with article 9 or 10, the appointing authority may, at the request of a party, appoint a sole arbitrator pursuant to the procedure provided for in article 8, paragraph 2, if it determines that, in view of the circumstances of the case, this is more appropriate. Appointment of arbitrators (articles 8 to 10)\\n\\nArticle 8\\n\\n1. If the parties have agreed that a sole arbitrator is to be appointed and if within 30 days after receipt by all other parties of a proposal for the appointment of a sole arbitrator the parties have not reached agreement thereon, a sole arbitrator shall, at the request of a party, be appointed by the appointing authority.\\n\\n2. The appointing authority shall appoint the sole arbitrator as promptly as possible. In making the appointment, the appointing authority shall use the following list-procedure, unless the parties agree that the list-procedure should not be used or unless the appointing authority determines in its discretion that the use of the list-procedure is not appropriate for the case: (a) The appointing authority shall communicate to each of the parties an identical list containing at least three names;\\n\\n2. The appointing authority shall appoint the sole arbitrator as promptly as possible. In making the appointment, the appointing authority shall use the following list-procedure, unless the parties agree that the list-procedure should not be used or unless the appointing authority determines in its discretion that the use of the list-procedure is not appropriate for the case: (a) The appointing authority shall communicate to each of the parties an identical list containing at least three names;\\n\\nWithin 15 days after the receipt of this list, each party may return the list to the appointing authority after having deleted the name or names to which it objects\\n\\n8\\n\\nand numbered the remaining names on the list in the order of its preference;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nAfter the expiration of the above period of time the appointing authority shall appoint the sole arbitrator from among the names approved on the lists returned to it and in accordance with the order of preference indicated by the parties;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nIf for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the appointing authority may exercise its discretion in appointing the sole arbitrator.\\n\\nArticle 9\\n\\n1. If three arbitrators are to be appointed, each party shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall choose the third arbitrator who will act as the presiding arbitrator of the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n2. If within 30 days after the receipt of a party’s notification of the appointment of an arbitrator the other party has not notified the first party of the arbitrator it has appointed, the first party may request the appointing authority to appoint the second arbitrator.\\n\\n3. If within 30 days after the appointment of the second arbitrator the two arbitrators have not agreed on the choice of the presiding arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the appointing authority in the same way as a sole arbitrator would be appointed under article 8.\\n\\nArticle 10\\n\\n1. For the purposes of article 9, paragraph 1, where three arbitrators are to be appointed and there are multiple parties as claimant or as respondent, unless the parties have agreed to another method of appointment of arbitrators, the multiple parties jointly, whether as claimant or as respondent, shall appoint an arbitrator.\\n\\n2. If the parties have agreed that the arbitral tribunal is to be composed of a number of arbitrators other than one or three, the arbitrators shall be appointed according to the method agreed upon by the parties.\\n\\n3. In the event of any failure to constitute the arbitral tribunal under these Rules, the appointing authority shall, at the request of any party, constitute the arbitral tribunal and, in doing so,\\n\\n9\\n\\nmay revoke any appointment already made and appoint or reappoint each of the arbitrators and designate one of them as the presiding arbitrator.\\n\\nDisclosures by and challenge of arbitrators** (articles 11 to 13)\\n\\nArticle 11\\n\\nWhen a person is approached in connection with his or her possible appointment as an arbitrator, he or she shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, from the time of his or her appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties and the other arbitrators unless they have already been informed by him or her of these circumstances.\\n\\nArticle 12\\n\\n1. Any arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality or independence.\\n\\n2. A party may challenge the arbitrator appointed by it only for reasons of which it becomes aware after the appointment has been made.\\n\\n3. In the event that an arbitrator fails to act or in the event of the de jure or de facto impossibility of his or her performing his or her functions, the procedure in respect of the challenge of an arbitrator as provided in article 13 shall apply.\\n\\nArticle 13\\n\\n1. A party that intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of its challenge within 15 days after it has been notified of the appointment of the challenged arbitrator, or within 15 days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 11 and 12 became known to that party.\\n\\n** Model statements of independence pursuant to article 11 can be found in the\\n\\nannex to the Rules.\\n\\n10\\n\\n2. The notice of challenge shall be communicated to all other parties, to the arbitrator who is challenged and to the other arbitrators. The notice of challenge shall state the reasons for the challenge.\\n\\n3. When an arbitrator has been challenged by a party, all parties may agree to the challenge. The arbitrator may also, after the challenge, withdraw from his or her office. In neither case does this imply acceptance of the validity of the grounds for the challenge. If, within 15 days from the date of the notice of challenge, all 4. parties do not agree to the challenge or the challenged arbitrator does not withdraw, the party making the challenge may elect to pursue it. In that case, within 30 days from the date of the notice of challenge, it shall seek a decision on the challenge by the appointing authority.\\n\\nReplacement of an arbitrator\\n\\nArticle 14\\n\\n1. Subject to paragraph 2, in any event where an arbitrator has to be replaced during the course of the arbitral proceedings, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed or chosen pursuant to the procedure provided for in articles 8 to 11 that was applicable to the appointment or choice of the arbitrator being replaced. This procedure shall apply even if during the process of appointing the arbitrator to be replaced, a party had failed to exercise its right to appoint or to participate in the appointment.\\n\\n2. If, at the request of a party, the appointing authority determines that, in view of the exceptional circumstances of the case, it would be justified for a party to be deprived of its right to appoint a substitute arbitrator, the appointing authority may, after giving an opportunity to the parties and the remaining arbitrators to express their views: (a) appoint the substitute arbitrator; or (b) after the closure of the hearings, authorize the other arbitrators to proceed with the arbitration and make any decision or award. Repetition of hearings in the event of the replacement of an arbitrator\\n\\nArticle 15\\n\\nIf an arbitrator is replaced, the proceedings shall resume at the stage where the arbitrator who was replaced ceased to perform his or her functions, unless the arbitral tribunal decides otherwise.\\n\\n11\\n\\nExclusion of liability\\n\\nArticle 16\\n\\nSave for intentional wrongdoing, the parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable law, any claim against the arbitrators, the appointing authority and any person appointed by the arbitral tribunal based on any act or omission in connection with the arbitration.\\n\\n12\\n\\nSection III. Arbitral proceedings\\n\\nGeneral provisions\\n\\nArticle 17\\n\\n1. Subject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at an appropriate stage of the proceedings each party is given a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case. The arbitral tribunal, in exercising its discretion, shall conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties’ dispute.\\n\\n2. As soon as practicable after its constitution and after inviting the parties to express their views, the arbitral tribunal shall establish the provisional timetable of the arbitration. The arbitral tribunal may, at any time, after inviting the parties to express their views, extend or abridge any period of time prescribed under these Rules or agreed by the parties.\\n\\n3. If at an appropriate stage of the proceedings any party so requests, the arbitral tribunal shall hold hearings for the presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral argument. In the absence of such a request, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold such hearings or whether the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.\\n\\n4. All communications to the arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated by that party to all other parties. Such communications shall be made at the same time, except as otherwise permitted by the arbitral tribunal if it may do so under applicable law.\\n\\n5. The arbitral tribunal may, at the request of any party, allow one or more third persons to be joined in the arbitration as a party provided such person is a party to the arbitration agreement, unless the arbitral tribunal finds, after giving all parties, including the person or persons to be joined, the opportunity to be heard, that joinder should not be permitted because of prejudice to any of those parties. The arbitral tribunal may make a single award or several awards in respect of all parties so involved in the arbitration. 13\\n\\nPlace of arbitration\\n\\nArticle 18\\n\\n1. If the parties have not previously agreed on the place of arbitration, the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case. The award shall be deemed to have been made at the place of arbitration.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal may meet at any location it considers appropriate for deliberations. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may also meet at any location it considers appropriate for any other purpose, including hearings.\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nArticle 19\\n\\n1. Subject to an agreement by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall, promptly after its appointment, determine the language or languages to be used in the proceedings. This determination shall apply to the statement of claim, the statement of defence, and any further written statements and, if oral hearings take place, to the language or languages to be used in such hearings.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal may order that any documents annexed to the statement of claim or statement of defence, and any supplementary documents or exhibits submitted in the course of the proceedings, delivered in their original language, shall be accompanied by a translation into the language or languages agreed upon by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nStatement of claim\\n\\nArticle 20\\n\\n1. The claimant shall communicate its statement of claim in writing to the respondent and to each of the arbitrators within a period of time to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. The claimant may elect to treat its notice of arbitration referred to in article 3 as a statement of claim, provided that the notice of arbitration also complies with the requirements of paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article. 14\\n\\n2. The statement of claim shall include the following particulars:\\n\\n(a) The names and contact details of the parties;\\n\\n(b) A statement of the facts supporting the claim;\\n\\n(c) The points at issue;\\n\\n(d) The relief or remedy sought;\\n\\n(e) The legal grounds or arguments supporting the claim.\\n\\n3. A copy of any contract or other legal instrument out of or in relation to which the dispute arises and of the arbitration agreement shall be annexed to the statement of claim.\\n\\n4. The statement of claim should, as far as possible, be accompanied by all documents and other evidence relied upon by the claimant, or contain references to them.\\n\\nStatement of defence\\n\\nArticle 21\\n\\n1. The respondent shall communicate its statement of defence in writing to the claimant and to each of the arbitrators within a period of time to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. The respondent may elect to treat its response to the notice of arbitration referred to in article 4 as a statement of defence, provided that the response to the notice of arbitration also complies with the requirements of paragraph 2 of this article.\\n\\n2. The statement of defence shall reply to the particulars (b) to (e) of the statement of claim (art. 20, para. 2). The statement of defence should, as far as possible, be accompanied by all documents and other evidence relied upon by the respondent, or contain references to them.\\n\\n3. In its statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral proceedings if the arbitral tribunal decides that the delay was justified under the circumstances, the respondent may make a counterclaim or rely on a claim for the purpose of a set-off provided that the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction over it.\\n\\n4. The provisions of article 20, paragraphs 2 to 4, shall apply to a counterclaim, a claim under article 4, paragraph 2 (f), and a claim relied on for the purpose of a set-off.\\n\\n15\\n\\nAmendments to the claim or defence\\n\\nArticle 22\\n\\nDuring the course of the arbitral proceedings, a party may amend or supplement its claim or defence, including a counterclaim or a claim for the purpose of a set-off, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to other parties or any other circumstances. However, a claim or defence, including a counterclaim or a claim for the purpose of a set-off, may not be amended or supplemented in such a manner that the amended or supplemented claim or defence falls outside the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nPleas as to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal\\n\\nArticle 23\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause that forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null shall not entail automatically the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\\n\\n2. A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence or, with respect to a counterclaim or a claim for the purpose of a set-off, in the reply to the counterclaim or to the claim for the purpose of a set-off. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that it has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.\\n\\n3. The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. The arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award, notwithstanding any pending challenge to its jurisdiction before a court. 16\\n\\nFurther written statements\\n\\nArticle 24\\n\\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide which further written statements, in addition to the statement of claim and the statement of defence, shall be required from the parties or may be presented by them and shall fix the periods of time for communicating such statements.\\n\\nPeriods of time\\n\\nArticle 25\\n\\nThe periods of time fixed by the arbitral tribunal for the communication of written statements (including the statement of claim and statement of defence) should not exceed 45 days. However, the arbitral tribunal may extend the time limits if it concludes that an extension is justified.\\n\\nInterim measures\\n\\nArticle 26\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant interim measures.\\n\\n2. An interim measure is any temporary measure by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for example and without limitation, to: (a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;\\n\\n2. An interim measure is any temporary measure by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for example and without limitation, to: (a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nTake action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, (i) current or imminent harm or (ii) prejudice to the arbitral process itself;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nProvide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied; or\\n\\nPreserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute.\\n\\n3. The party requesting an interim measure under paragraphs 2 (a) to (c) shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nHarm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such\\n\\n17\\n\\nharm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nThere is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subsequent determination.\\n\\n4. With regard to a request for an interim measure under paragraph 2 (d), the requirements in paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) shall apply only to the extent the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.\\n\\n5. The arbitral tribunal may modify, suspend or terminate an interim measure it has granted, upon application of any party or, in exceptional circumstances and upon prior notice to the parties, on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative.\\n\\n6. The arbitral tribunal may require the party requesting an interim measure to provide appropriate security in connection with the measure.\\n\\n7. The arbitral tribunal may require any party promptly to disclose any material change in the circumstances on the basis of which the interim measure was requested or granted.\\n\\n8. The party requesting an interim measure may be liable for any costs and damages caused by the measure to any party if the arbitral tribunal later determines that, in the circumstances then prevailing, the measure should not have been granted. The arbitral tribunal may award such costs and damages at any point during the proceedings.\\n\\n9. A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement.\\n\\nEvidence\\n\\nArticle 27\\n\\n1. Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence.\\n\\n2. Witnesses, including expert witnesses, who are presented by the parties to testify to the arbitral tribunal on any issue of fact or expertise may be any individual, notwithstanding that\\n\\n18\\n\\nthe individual is a party to the arbitration or in any way related to a party. Unless otherwise directed by the arbitral tribunal, statements by witnesses, including expert witnesses, may be presented in writing and signed by them.\\n\\n3. At any time during the arbitral proceedings the arbitral tribunal may require the parties to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence within such a period of time as the arbitral tribunal shall determine.\\n\\n4. The arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\\n\\nHearings\\n\\nArticle 28\\n\\nIn the event of an oral hearing, the arbitral tribunal shall 1. give the parties adequate advance notice of the date, time and place thereof.\\n\\n2. Witnesses, including expert witnesses, may be heard under the conditions and examined in the manner set by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n3. Hearings shall be held in camera unless the parties agree otherwise. The arbitral tribunal may require the retirement of any witness or witnesses, including expert witnesses, during the testimony of such other witnesses, except that a witness, including an expert witness, who is a party to the arbitration shall not, in principle, be asked to retire.\\n\\n4. The arbitral tribunal may direct that witnesses, including expert witnesses, be examined through means of telecommunication that do not require their physical presence at the hearing (such as videoconference).\\n\\nExperts appointed by the arbitral tribunal\\n\\nArticle 29\\n\\n1. After consultation with the parties, the arbitral tribunal may appoint one or more independent experts to report to it, in writing, on specific issues to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. A copy of the expert’s terms of reference, established by the arbitral tribunal, shall be communicated to the parties. 19\\n\\n2. The expert shall, in principle before accepting appointment, submit to the arbitral tribunal and to the parties a description of his or her qualifications and a statement of his or her impartiality and independence. Within the time ordered by the arbitral tribunal, the parties shall inform the arbitral tribunal whether they have any objections as to the expert’s qualifications, impartiality or independence. The arbitral tribunal shall decide promptly whether to accept any such objections. After an expert’s appointment, a party may object to the expert’s qualifications, impartiality or independence only if the objection is for reasons of which the party becomes aware after the appointment has been made. The arbitral tribunal shall decide promptly what, if any, action to take.\\n\\n3. The parties shall give the expert any relevant information or produce for his or her inspection any relevant documents or goods that he or she may require of them. Any dispute between a party and such expert as to the relevance of the required information or production shall be referred to the arbitral tribunal for decision.\\n\\n4. Upon receipt of the expert’s report, the arbitral tribunal shall communicate a copy of the report to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity to express, in writing, their opinion on the report. A party shall be entitled to examine any document on which the expert has relied in his or her report.\\n\\n5. At the request of any party, the expert, after delivery of the report, may be heard at a hearing where the parties shall have the opportunity to be present and to interrogate the expert. At this hearing, any party may present expert witnesses in order to testify on the points at issue. The provisions of article 28 shall be applicable to such proceedings.\\n\\nDefault\\n\\nArticle 30\\n\\n1. tribunal, without showing sufficient cause:\\n\\nIf, within the period of time fixed by these Rules or the arbitral\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nThe claimant has failed to communicate its statement of claim, the arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings, unless there are remaining matters that may need to be decided and the arbitral tribunal considers it appropriate to do so;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nThe respondent has failed to communicate its response to the notice of arbitration or its statement of defence, the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings\\n\\n20\\n\\ncontinue, without treating such failure in itself as an admission of the claimant’s allegations; the provisions of this subparagraph also apply to a claimant’s failure to submit a defence to a counterclaim or to a claim for the purpose of a set-off.\\n\\n2. If a party, duly notified under these Rules, fails to appear at a hearing, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration.\\n\\n3. If a party, duly invited by the arbitral tribunal to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence, fails to do so within the established period of time, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence before it.\\n\\nClosure of hearings\\n\\nArticle 31\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal may inquire of the parties if they have any further proof to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions to make and, if there are none, it may declare the hearings closed.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal may, if it considers it necessary owing to exceptional circumstances, decide, on its own initiative or upon application of a party, to reopen the hearings at any time before the award is made.\\n\\nWaiver of right to object\\n\\nArticle 32\\n\\nA failure by any party to object promptly to any non- compliance with these Rules or with any requirement of the arbitration agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right of such party to make such an objection, unless such party can show that, under the circumstances, its failure to object was justified.\\n\\n21\\n\\nSection IV. The award\\n\\nDecisions\\n\\nArticle 33\\n\\n1. When there is more than one arbitrator, any award or other decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be made by a majority of the arbitrators.\\n\\n2. In the case of questions of procedure, when there is no majority or when the arbitral tribunal so authorizes, the presiding arbitrator may decide alone, subject to revision, if any, by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nForm and effect of the award\\n\\nArticle 34\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal may make separate awards on different issues at different times.\\n\\n2. All awards shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties. The parties shall carry out all awards without delay.\\n\\n3. The arbitral tribunal shall state the reasons upon which the award is based, unless the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given.\\n\\n4. An award shall be signed by the arbitrators and it shall contain the date on which the award was made and indicate the place of arbitration. Where there is more than one arbitrator and any of them fails to sign, the award shall state the reason for the absence of the signature.\\n\\n5. An award may be made public with the consent of all parties or where and to the extent disclosure is required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or in relation to legal proceedings before a court or other competent authority.\\n\\n6. Copies of the award signed by the arbitrators shall be communicated to the parties by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n22\\n\\nApplicable law, amiable compositeur\\n\\nArticle 35\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law which it determines to be appropriate.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall decide as amiable compositeur or ex aequo et bono only if the parties have expressly authorized the arbitral tribunal to do so.\\n\\n3. In all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, if any, and shall take into account any usage of trade applicable to the transaction.\\n\\nSettlement or other grounds for termination\\n\\nArticle 36\\n\\n1. If, before the award is made, the parties agree on a settlement of the dispute, the arbitral tribunal shall either issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings or, if requested by the parties and accepted by the arbitral tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms. The arbitral tribunal is not obliged to give reasons for such an award.\\n\\n2. If, before the award is made, the continuation of the arbitral proceedings becomes unnecessary or impossible for any reason not mentioned in paragraph 1, the arbitral tribunal shall inform the parties of its intention to issue an order for the termination of the proceedings. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to issue such an order unless there are remaining matters that may need to be decided and the arbitral tribunal considers it appropriate to do so.\\n\\n3. Copies of the order for termination of the arbitral proceedings or of the arbitral award on agreed terms, signed by the arbitrators, shall be communicated by the arbitral tribunal to the parties. Where an arbitral award on agreed terms is made, the provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2, 4 and 5, shall apply. 23\\n\\nInterpretation of the award\\n\\nArticle 37\\n\\n1. Within 30 days after the receipt of the award, a party, with notice to the other parties, may request that the arbitral tribunal give an interpretation of the award.\\n\\n2. The interpretation shall be given in writing within 45 days after the receipt of the request. The interpretation shall form part of the award and the provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2 to 6, shall apply.\\n\\nCorrection of the award\\n\\nArticle 38\\n\\n1. Within 30 days after the receipt of the award, a party, with notice to the other parties, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct in the award any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error, or any error or omission of a similar nature. If the arbitral tribunal considers that the request is justified, it shall make the correction within 45 days of receipt of the request.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal may within 30 days after the communication of the award make such corrections on its own initiative.\\n\\n3. Such corrections shall be in writing and shall form part of the award. The provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2 to 6, shall apply.\\n\\nAdditional award\\n\\nArticle 39\\n\\n1. Within 30 days after the receipt of the termination order or the award, a party, with notice to the other parties, may request the arbitral tribunal to make an award or an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but not decided by the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\n2. If the arbitral tribunal considers the request for an award or additional award to be justified, it shall render or complete its award within 60 days after the receipt of the request. The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make the award. 24\\n\\n3. When such an award or additional award is made, the provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2 to 6, shall apply.\\n\\nDefinition of costs\\n\\nArticle 40\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\\n\\n2. The term “costs” includes only:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nThe fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nThe reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nThe reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nThe reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nThe legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nAny fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\\n\\n3. In relation to interpretation, correction or completion of any award under articles 37 to 39, the arbitral tribunal may charge the costs referred to in paragraphs 2 (b) to (f), but no additional fees.\\n\\nFees and expenses of arbitrators\\n\\nArticle 41\\n\\n1. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2. If there is an appointing authority and it applies or has stated that it will apply a schedule or particular method for determining the fees for arbitrators in international cases, the arbitral tribunal in\\n\\n25\\n\\nfixing its fees shall take that schedule or method into account to the extent that it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n3. Promptly after its constitution, the arbitral tribunal shall inform the parties as to how it proposes to determine its fees and expenses, including any rates it intends to apply. Within 15 days of receiving that proposal, any party may refer the proposal to the appointing authority for review. If, within 45 days of receipt of such a referral, the appointing authority finds that the proposal of the arbitral tribunal is inconsistent with paragraph 1, it shall make any necessary adjustments thereto, which shall be binding upon the arbitral tribunal. 4. (a) When informing the parties of the arbitrators’ fees and expenses that have been fixed pursuant to article 40, paragraphs 2 (a) and (b), the arbitral tribunal shall also explain the manner in which the corresponding amounts have been calculated;\\n\\n3. Promptly after its constitution, the arbitral tribunal shall inform the parties as to how it proposes to determine its fees and expenses, including any rates it intends to apply. Within 15 days of receiving that proposal, any party may refer the proposal to the appointing authority for review. If, within 45 days of receipt of such a referral, the appointing authority finds that the proposal of the arbitral tribunal is inconsistent with paragraph 1, it shall make any necessary adjustments thereto, which shall be binding upon the arbitral tribunal. 4. (a) When informing the parties of the arbitrators’ fees and expenses that have been fixed pursuant to article 40, paragraphs 2 (a) and (b), the arbitral tribunal shall also explain the manner in which the corresponding amounts have been calculated;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nWithin 15 days of receiving the arbitral tribunal’s determination of fees and expenses, any party may refer for review such determination to the appointing authority. If no appointing authority has been agreed upon or designated, or if the appointing authority fails to act within the time specified in these Rules, then the review shall be made by the Secretary-General of the PCA;\\n\\nIf the appointing authority or the Secretary-General of the PCA finds that the arbitral tribunal’s determination is inconsistent with the arbitral tribunal’s proposal (and any adjustment thereto) under paragraph 3 or is otherwise manifestly excessive, it shall, within 45 days of receiving such a referral, make any adjustments to the arbitral tribunal’s determination that are necessary to satisfy the criteria in paragraph 1. Any such adjustments shall be binding upon the arbitral tribunal;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nAny such adjustments shall either be included by the arbitral tribunal in its award or, if the award has already been issued, be implemented in a correction to the award, to which the procedure of article 38, paragraph 3, shall apply.\\n\\n5. Throughout the procedure under paragraphs 3 and 4, the arbitral tribunal shall proceed with the arbitration, in accordance with article 17, paragraph 1.\\n\\n6. A referral under paragraph 4 shall not affect any determination in the award other than the arbitral tribunal’s fees and expenses;\\n\\n26\\n\\nnor shall it delay the recognition and enforcement of all parts of the award other than those relating to the determination of the arbitral tribunal’s fees and expenses.\\n\\nAllocation of costs\\n\\nArticle 42\\n\\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\\n\\nDeposit of costs\\n\\nArticle 43\\n\\n1. The arbitral tribunal, on its establishment, may request the parties to deposit an equal amount as an advance for the costs referred to in article 40, paragraphs 2 (a) to (c).\\n\\n2. During the course of the arbitral proceedings the arbitral tribunal may request supplementary deposits from the parties.\\n\\n3. If an appointing authority has been agreed upon or designated, and when a party so requests and the appointing authority consents to perform the function, the arbitral tribunal shall fix the amounts of any deposits or supplementary deposits only after consultation with the appointing authority, which may make any comments to the arbitral tribunal that it deems appropriate concerning the amount of such deposits and supplementary deposits.\\n\\n4. If the required deposits are not paid in full within 30 days after the receipt of the request, the arbitral tribunal shall so inform the parties in order that one or more of them may make the required payment. If such payment is not made, the arbitral tribunal may order the suspension or termination of the arbitral proceedings. 27\\n\\n5. After a termination order or final award has been made, the arbitral tribunal shall render an accounting to the parties of the deposits received and return any unexpended balance to the parties.\\n\\n28\\n\\nANNex\\n\\nModel arbitration clause for contracts\\n\\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\\n\\nNote. Parties should consider adding:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nThe appointing authority shall be ... [name of institution or person];\\n\\n(b) The number of arbitrators shall be ... [one or three];\\n\\n(c) The place of arbitration shall be ... [town and country];\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nThe language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be ... .\\n\\nPossible waiver statement\\n\\nNote. If the parties wish to exclude recourse against the arbitral award that may be available under the applicable law, they may consider adding a provision to that effect as suggested below, considering, however, that the effectiveness and conditions of such an exclusion depend on the applicable law.\\n\\nWaiver\\n\\nThe parties hereby waive their right to any form of recourse against an award to any court or other competent authority, insofar as such waiver can validly be made under the applicable law.\\n\\nModel statements of independence pursuant to article 11 of the Rules\\n\\nNo circumstances to disclose\\n\\nI am impartial and independent of each of the parties and intend to remain so. To the best of my knowledge, there are no circumstances, past or present, likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to my impartiality or independence.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\\n\\nArticle 1. Scope of application1\\n\\n(1) This Law applies to international commercial2 arbitration, subject to any agreement in force between this State and any other State or States.\\n\\n(2) The provisions of this Law, except articles 8, 9, 17 H, 17 I, 17 J, 35 and 36, apply only if the place of arbitration is in the territory of this State.\\n\\n(Article 1(2) has been amended by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\n(3) An arbitration is international if:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe parties to an arbitration agreement have, at the time of the conclu-\\n\\nsion of that agreement, their places of business in different States; or\\n\\n1Article headings are for reference purposes only and are not to be used for purposes of\\n\\ninterpretation.\\n\\n2The term “commercial” should be given a wide interpretation so as to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or not.

Deﬁ nitions and rules of interpretation\\n\\nFor the purposes of this Law:\\n\\n(a) “arbitration” means any arbitration whether or not administered\\n\\nby a permanent arbitral institution;\\n\\n(b) “arbitral tribunal” means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators;\\n\\n(c) “court” means a body or organ of the judicial system of a State;\\n\\n(d) where a provision of this Law, except article 28, leaves the parties free to determine a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorize a third party, including an institution, to make that determination;\\n\\n(e) where a provision of this Law refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refers to an agree- ment of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration rules referred to in that agreement;\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n(f) where a provision of this Law, other than in articles 25(a) and 32(2) (a), refers to a claim, it also applies to a counter-claim, and where it refers to a defence, it also applies to a defence to such counter-claim.\\n\\nArticle 2 A.\\n\\nInternational origin and general principles\\n\\n(As adopted by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\n(1) In the interpretation of this Law, regard is to be had to its international origin and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith.\\n\\n(2) Questions concerning matters governed by this Law which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which this Law is based.\\n\\nArticle 3. Receipt of written communications\\n\\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties:\\n\\n(a) any written communication is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence or mailing address; if none of these can be found after making a reasonable inquiry, a written communication is deemed to have been received if it is sent to the addressee’s last-known place of busi- ness, habitual residence or mailing address by registered letter or any other means which provides a record of the attempt to deliver it;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe communication is deemed to have been received on the day\\n\\nit is so delivered.\\n\\n(2) The provisions of this article do not apply to communications in court proceedings.\\n\\nArticle 4. Waiver of right to object\\n\\nA party who knows that any provision of this Law from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time-limit is provided therefor, within such period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to object.\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nArticle 5.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\\n\\nOption I\\n\\nArticle 7. Deﬁ nition and form of arbitration agreement\\n\\n(As adopted by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\n(1) “Arbitration agreement” is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a deﬁ ned legal relationship, whether contractual or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.\\n\\n(2) The arbitration agreement shall be in writing.\\n\\n(3) An arbitration agreement is in writing if its content is recorded in any form, whether or not the arbitration agreement or contract has been con- cluded orally, by conduct, or by other means.\\n\\n(4) The requirement that an arbitration agreement be in writing is met by an electronic communication if the information contained therein is acces- sible so as to be useable for subsequent reference; “electronic communica- tion” means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages; “data message” means information generated, sent, received or stored by electronic, magnetic, optical or similar means, including, but not\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nlimited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy.\\n\\n(5) Furthermore, an arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other.\\n\\n(6) The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the ref- erence is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\\n\\nOption II\\n\\nArticle 7. Deﬁ nition of arbitration agreement\\n\\n(As adopted by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\n“Arbitration agreement” is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitra- tion all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a deﬁ ned legal relationship, whether contractual or not.\\n\\nArticle 8. Arbitration agreement and substantive claim before court\\n\\n(1) A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting his ﬁ rst statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it ﬁ nds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\\n\\n(2) Where an action referred to in paragraph (1) of this article has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court.\\n\\nArticle 9. Arbitration agreement and interim measures by court\\n\\nIt is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant such measure.\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nCHAPTER III. COMPOSITION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\\n\\nArticle 10. Number of arbitrators\\n\\n(1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.\\n\\n(2) Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators shall be three.\\n\\nArticle 11. Appointment of arbitrators\\n\\n(1) No person shall be precluded by reason of his nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\\n\\n(2) The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this article.\\n\\n(3) Failing such agreement,\\n\\nin an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within thirty days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6;\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nin an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, he shall be appointed, upon request of a party, by the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(4) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,\\n\\n(a) a party fails to act as required under such procedure, or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe parties, or two arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement\\n\\nexpected of them under such procedure, or\\n\\n(c) a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function\\n\\nentrusted to it under such procedure,\\n\\nany party may request the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6 to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment pro- cedure provides other means for securing the appointment.\\n\\n(5) A decision on a matter entrusted by paragraph (3) or (4) of this article to the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6 shall be subject to no\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nappeal. The court or other authority, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to any qualiﬁ cations required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appoint- ment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and, in the case of a sole or third arbitrator, shall take into account as well the advisability of appoint- ing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties.\\n\\nArticle 12. Grounds for challenge\\n\\n(1) When a person is approached in connection with his possible appoint- ment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justiﬁ able doubts as to his impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed of them by him.\\n\\n(2) An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justiﬁ able doubts as to his impartiality or independence, or if he does not possess qualiﬁ cations agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitra- tor appointed by him, or in whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment has been made.\\n\\nArticle 13. Challenge procedure\\n\\n(1) The parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitra- tor, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this article.\\n\\n(2) Failing such agreement, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within ﬁ fteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstance referred to in article 12(2), send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. Unless the challenged arbitrator withdraws from his ofﬁ ce or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.\\n\\n(3) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure of paragraph (2) of this article is not successful, the challeng- ing party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6 to decide on the challenge, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nArticle 14. Failure or impossibility to act\\n\\n(1) If an arbitrator becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his func- tions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, his mandate terminates if he withdraws from his ofﬁ ce or if the parties agree on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the court or other authority speciﬁ ed in article 6 to decide on the termination of the mandate, which decision shall be subject to no appeal.\\n\\n(2) If, under this article or article 13(2), an arbitrator withdraws from his ofﬁ ce or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this article or article 12(2).\\n\\nArticle 15. Appointment of substitute arbitrator\\n\\nWhere the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under article 13 or 14 or because of his withdrawal from ofﬁ ce for any other reason or because of the revocation of his mandate by agreement of the parties or in any other case of termination of his mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitra- tor being replaced.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. JURISDICTION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\\n\\nArticle 16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction\\n\\n(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agree- ment. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the con- tract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\\n\\n(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tri- bunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nmatter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justiﬁ ed.\\n\\n(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the court speciﬁ ed in article 6 to decide the matter, which deci- sion shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV A.\\n\\nINTERIM MEASURES\\n\\nAND PRELIMINARY ORDERS\\n\\n(As adopted by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\nSection 1. Interim measures\\n\\nArticle 17. Power of arbitral tribunal to order interim measures\\n\\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant interim measures.\\n\\n(2) An interim measure is any temporary measure, whether in the form of an award or in another form, by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is ﬁ nally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party to:\\n\\n(a) Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the\\n\\ndispute;\\n\\n(b) Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, current or imminent harm or prejudice to the arbitral process itself;\\n\\n(c) Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent\\n\\naward may be satisﬁ ed; or\\n\\n(d) Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolu-\\n\\ntion of the dispute.\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nArticle 17 A. Conditions for granting interim measures\\n\\n(1) The party requesting an interim measure under article 17(2)(a), (b) and (c) shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that:\\n\\n(a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and\\n\\n(b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subse- quent determination.\\n\\n(2) With regard to a request for an interim measure under article 17(2)(d), the requirements in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) of this article shall apply only to the extent the arbitral tribunal considers appropriate.\\n\\nSection 2. Preliminary orders\\n\\nArticle 17 B. Applications for preliminary orders and conditions for granting preliminary orders\\n\\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party may, without notice to any other party, make a request for an interim measure together with an application for a preliminary order directing a party not to frustrate the purpose of the interim measure requested.\\n\\n(2) The arbitral tribunal may grant a preliminary order provided it considers that prior disclosure of the request for the interim measure to the party against whom it is directed risks frustrating the purpose of the measure.\\n\\n(3) The conditions deﬁ ned under article 17A apply to any preliminary order, provided that the harm to be assessed under article 17A(1)(a), is the harm likely to result from the order being granted or not.\\n\\nArticle 17 C. Speciﬁ c regime for preliminary orders\\n\\n(1) Immediately after the arbitral tribunal has made a determination in respect of an application for a preliminary order, the arbitral tribunal shall give notice to all parties of the request for the interim measure, the application for\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nthe preliminary order, the preliminary order, if any, and all other communi- cations, including by indicating the content of any oral communication, be- tween any party and the arbitral tribunal in relation thereto.\\n\\n(2) At the same time, the arbitral tribunal shall give an opportunity to any party against whom a preliminary order is directed to present its case at the earliest practicable time.\\n\\n(3) The arbitral tribunal shall decide promptly on any objection to the preliminary order.\\n\\n(4) A preliminary order shall expire after twenty days from the date on which it was issued by the arbitral tribunal. However, the arbitral tribunal may issue an interim measure adopting or modifying the preliminary order, after the party against whom the preliminary order is directed has been given notice and an opportunity to present its case.\\n\\n(5) A preliminary order shall be binding on the parties but shall not be subject to enforcement by a court. Such a preliminary order does not con- stitute an award.\\n\\nSection 3. Provisions applicable to interim measures and preliminary orders\\n\\nArticle 17 D. Modiﬁ cation, suspension, termination\\n\\nThe arbitral tribunal may modify, suspend or terminate an interim measure or a preliminary order it has granted, upon application of any party or, in exceptional circumstances and upon prior notice to the parties, on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative.\\n\\nArticle 17 E. Provision of security\\n\\n(1) The arbitral tribunal may require the party requesting an interim measure to provide appropriate security in connection with the measure.\\n\\n(2) The arbitral tribunal shall require the party applying for a preliminary order to provide security in connection with the order unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate or unnecessary to do so.\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nArticle 17 F. Disclosure\\n\\n(1) The arbitral tribunal may require any party promptly to disclose any material change in the circumstances on the basis of which the measure was requested or granted.\\n\\n(2) The party applying for a preliminary order shall disclose to the arbitral tribunal all circumstances that are likely to be relevant to the arbitral tribu- nal’s determination whether to grant or maintain the order, and such obliga- tion shall continue until the party against whom the order has been requested has had an opportunity to present its case. Thereafter, paragraph (1) of this article shall apply.\\n\\nArticle 17 G. Costs and damages\\n\\nThe party requesting an interim measure or applying for a preliminary order shall be liable for any costs and damages caused by the measure or the order to any party if the arbitral tribunal later determines that, in the circumstances, the measure or the order should not have been granted. The arbitral tribunal may award such costs and damages at any point during the proceedings.\\n\\nSection 4. Recognition and enforcement of interim measures\\n\\nArticle 17 H. Recognition and enforcement\\n\\n(1) An interim measure issued by an arbitral tribunal shall be recognized as binding and, unless otherwise provided by the arbitral tribunal, enforced upon application to the competent court, irrespective of the country in which it was issued, subject to the provisions of article 17 I.\\n\\n(2) The party who is seeking or has obtained recognition or enforcement of an interim measure shall promptly inform the court of any termination, suspension or modiﬁ cation of that interim measure.\\n\\n(3) The court of the State where recognition or enforcement is sought may, if it considers it proper, order the requesting party to provide appropriate security if the arbitral tribunal has not already made a determination with respect to security or where such a decision is necessary to protect the rights of third parties.\\n\\nPart One. UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nArticle 17 I. Grounds for refusing recognition or enforcement3\\n\\n(1) Recognition or enforcement of an interim measure may be refused only:\\n\\n(a) At the request of the party against whom it is invoked if the court\\n\\nis satisﬁ ed that:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nSuch refusal is warranted on the grounds set forth in arti- cle 36(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv); or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nThe arbitral tribunal’s decision with respect to the provision of security in connection with the interim measure issued by the arbitral tribunal has not been complied with; or\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nThe interim measure has been terminated or suspended by the arbitral tribunal or, where so empowered, by the court of the State in which the arbitration takes place or under the law of which that interim measure was granted; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nIf the court ﬁ nds that:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nThe interim measure is incompatible with the powers con- ferred upon the court unless the court decides to reformulate the interim measure to the extent necessary to adapt it to its own powers and procedures for the purposes of enforcing that interim measure and without modifying its substance; or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nAny of the grounds set forth in article 36(1)(b)(i) or (ii), apply to the recognition and enforcement of the interim measure.\\n\\n(2) Any determination made by the court on any ground in paragraph (1) of this article shall be effective only for the purposes of the application to recognize and enforce the interim measure. The court where recognition or enforcement is sought shall not, in making that determination, undertake a review of the substance of the interim measure.\\n\\nSection 5. Court-ordered interim measures\\n\\nArticle 17 J. Court-ordered interim measures\\n\\nA court shall have the same power of issuing an interim measure in relation to arbitration proceedings, irrespective of whether their place is in\\n\\n3The conditions set forth in article 17 I are intended to limit the number of circumstances in which the court may refuse to enforce an interim measure. It would not be contrary to the level of harmoniza- tion sought to be achieved by these model provisions if a State were to adopt fewer circumstances in which enforcement may be refused.\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nthe territory of this State, as it has in relation to proceedings in courts.

The parties may submit with their statements all documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the documents or other evidence they will submit.\\n\\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral proceed- ings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it.\\n\\nArticle 24. Hearings and written proceedings\\n\\n(1) Subject to any contrary agreement by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials. However, unless the parties have agreed that no hearings shall be held, the arbitral tribunal shall hold such hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by a party.\\n\\n(2) The parties shall be given sufﬁ cient advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for the purposes of inspection of goods, other property or documents.\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n(3) All statements, documents or other information supplied to the arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated to the other party.

RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS\\n\\nArticle 35. Recognition and enforcement\\n\\n(1) An arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, shall be recognized as binding and, upon application in writing to the\\n\\nPart One.

If the award is not made in an ofﬁ cial language of this State, the court may request the party to supply a translation thereof into such language.4\\n\\n(Article 35(2) has been amended by the Commission at its thirty-ninth session, in 2006)\\n\\nArticle 36. Grounds for refusing recognition or enforcement\\n\\n(1) Recognition or enforcement of an arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, may be refused only:\\n\\n(a) at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, if that party furnishes to the competent court where recognition or enforcement is sought proof that:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\na party to the arbitration agreement referred to in article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nthe party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nthe award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains deci- sions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nthe composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral proce- dure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or\\n\\n4The conditions set forth in this paragraph are intended to set maximum standards. It would, thus, not be contrary to the harmonization to be achieved by the model law if a State retained even less onerous conditions.\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n(v)\\n\\nthe award has not yet become binding on the parties or has been set aside or suspended by a court of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nif the court ﬁ nds that:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of this State; or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nthe recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of this State.\\n\\n(2) If an application for setting aside or suspension of an award has been made to a court referred to in paragraph (1)(a)(v) of this article, the court where recognition or enforcement is sought may, if it considers it proper, adjourn its decision and may also, on the application of the party claiming recognition or enforcement of the award, order the other party to provide appropriate security.\\n\\nPart Two\\n\\nExplanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat on the 1985 Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as amended in 20061\\n\\n1. The UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) was adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on 21 June 1985, at the end of the eighteenth session of the Commission. The General Assembly, in its resolution 40/72 of 11 December 1985, recommended “that all States give due consideration to the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, in view of the desirability of uniformity of the law of arbitral procedures and the speciﬁ c needs of international commercial arbitration practice”. The Model Law was amended by UNCITRAL on 7 July 2006, at the thirty-ninth session of the Commission (see below, paragraphs 4, 19, 20, 27, 29 and 53). The General Assembly, in its resolution 61/33 of 4 December 2006, recommended “that all States give favourable consideration to the enactment of the revised articles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitra- tion, or the revised UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitra- tion, when they enact or revise their laws (…)”.\\n\\n2. The Model Law constitutes a sound basis for the desired harmonization and improvement of national laws. It covers all stages of the arbitral process from the arbitration agreement to the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award and reﬂ ects a worldwide consensus on the principles and important issues of interna- tional arbitration practice. It is acceptable to States of all regions and the different legal or economic systems of the world. Since its adoption by UNCITRAL, the Model Law has come to represent the accepted international legislative standard for a modern arbitration law and a signiﬁ cant number of jurisdictions have enacted arbitration legislation based on the Model Law.\\n\\n3. The form of a model law was chosen as the vehicle for harmonization and modernization in view of the ﬂ exibility it gives to States in preparing new arbitra- tion laws. Notwithstanding that ﬂ exibility, and in order to increase the likelihood of achieving a satisfactory degree of harmonization, States are encouraged to make\\n\\n1This note was prepared by the secretariat of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for informational purposes only; it is not an ofﬁ cial commentary on the Model Law.

XVI — 1985, United Nations publication, Sales No. E.87.V.4).\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nas few changes as possible when incorporating the Model Law into their legal sys- tems. Efforts to minimize variation from the text adopted by UNCITRAL are also expected to increase the visibility of harmonization, thus enhancing the conﬁ dence of foreign parties, as the primary users of international arbitration, in the reliability of arbitration law in the enacting State.\\n\\n4. The revision of the Model Law adopted in 2006 includes article 2 A, which is designed to facilitate interpretation by reference to internationally accepted princi- ples and is aimed at promoting a uniform understanding of the Model Law. Other substantive amendments to the Model Law relate to the form of the arbitration agreement and to interim measures. The original 1985 version of the provision on the form of the arbitration agreement (article 7) was modelled on the language used in article II (2) of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958) (“the New York Convention”). The revision of article 7 is intended to address evolving practice in international trade and techno- logical developments. The extensive revision of article 17 on interim measures was considered necessary in light of the fact that such measures are increasingly relied upon in the practice of international commercial arbitration. The revision also includes an enforcement regime for such measures in recognition of the fact that the effectiveness of arbitration frequently depends upon the possibility of enforcing interim measures. The new provisions are contained in a new chapter of the Model Law on interim measures and preliminary orders (chapter IV A). A. Background to the Model Law\\n\\n5. The Model Law was developed to address considerable disparities in national laws on arbitration. The need for improvement and harmonization was based on ﬁ ndings that national laws were often particularly inappropriate for international cases.\\n\\n1. Inadequacy of domestic laws\\n\\n6. Recurrent inadequacies to be found in outdated national laws include provisions that equate the arbitral process with court litigation and fragmentary provisions that fail to address all relevant substantive law issues. Even most of those laws that appear to be up-to-date and comprehensive were drafted with domestic arbitration primarily, if not exclusively, in mind. While this approach is understandable in view of the fact that even today the bulk of cases governed by arbitration law would be of a purely domestic nature, the unfortunate consequence is that traditional local concepts are imposed on international cases and the needs of modern practice are often not met.\\n\\n7. The expectations of the parties as expressed in a chosen set of arbitration rules or a “one-off” arbitration agreement may be frustrated, especially by mandatory provisions of applicable law. Unexpected and undesired restrictions found in national\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\nlaws may prevent the parties, for example, from submitting future disputes to arbi- tration, from selecting the arbitrator freely, or from having the arbitral proceedings conducted according to agreed rules of procedure and with no more court involve- ment than appropriate. Frustration may also ensue from non-mandatory provisions that may impose undesired requirements on unwary parties who may not think about the need to provide otherwise when drafting the arbitration agreement. Even the absence of any legislative provision may cause difﬁ culties simply by leaving un- answered some of the many procedural issues relevant in arbitration and not always settled in the arbitration agreement. The Model Law is intended to reduce the risk of such possible frustration, difﬁ culties or surprise.\\n\\n2. Disparity between national laws\\n\\n8. Problems stemming from inadequate arbitration laws or from the absence of speciﬁ c legislation governing arbitration are aggravated by the fact that national laws differ widely. Such differences are a frequent source of concern in international arbitration, where at least one of the parties is, and often both parties are, confronted with foreign and unfamiliar provisions and procedures. Obtaining a full and precise account of the law applicable to the arbitration is, in such circumstances often expensive, impractical or impossible.\\n\\n9. Uncertainty about the local law with the inherent risk of frustration may adversely affect the functioning of the arbitral process and also impact on the selec- tion of the place of arbitration. Due to such uncertainty, a party may hesitate or refuse to agree to a place, which for practical reasons would otherwise be appropri- ate. The range of places of arbitration acceptable to parties is thus widened and the smooth functioning of the arbitral proceedings is enhanced where States adopt the Model Law, which is easily recognizable, meets the speciﬁ c needs of international commercial arbitration and provides an international standard based on solutions acceptable to parties from different legal systems.\\n\\nB. Salient features of the Model Law\\n\\n1. Special procedural regime for international commercial arbitration\\n\\n10. The principles and solutions adopted in the Model Law aim at reducing or eliminating the above-mentioned concerns and difﬁ culties. As a response to the inadequacies and disparities of national laws, the Model Law presents a special legal regime tailored to international commercial arbitration, without affecting any rele- vant treaty in force in the State adopting the Model Law. While the Model Law was designed with international commercial arbitration in mind, it offers a set of basic rules that are not, in and of themselves, unsuitable to any other type of arbi- tration. States may thus consider extending their enactment of the Model Law to cover also domestic disputes, as a number of enacting States already have.\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n(a) Substantive and territorial scope of application\\n\\n11.

The Model Law deﬁ nes an arbitration as international if “the parties to an arbitration agreement have, at the time of the conclusion of that agreement, their places of business in different States” (article 1 (3)). The vast majority of situations commonly regarded as international will meet this criterion. In addition, article 1 (3) broadens the notion of internation- ality so that the Model Law also covers cases where the place of arbitration, the place of contract performance, or the place of the subject-matter of the dispute is situated outside the State where the parties have their place of business, or cases where the parties have expressly agreed that the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement relates to more than one country. Article 1 thus recognizes extensively the freedom of the parties to submit a dispute to the legal regime established pursuant to the Model Law.\\n\\n12. In respect of the term “commercial”, the Model Law provides no strict deﬁ ni- tion. The footnote to article 1 (1) calls for “a wide interpretation” and offers an illustrative and open-ended list of relationships that might be described as com- mercial in nature, “whether contractual or not”. The purpose of the footnote is to circumvent any technical difﬁ culty that may arise, for example, in determining which transactions should be governed by a speciﬁ c body of “commercial law” that may exist in some legal systems.\\n\\n13. Another aspect of applicability is the territorial scope of application. The prin- ciple embodied in article 1 (2) is that the Model Law as enacted in a given State applies only if the place of arbitration is in the territory of that State. However, article 1 (2) also contains important exceptions to that principle, to the effect that certain articles apply, irrespective of whether the place of arbitration is in the enact- ing State or elsewhere (or, as the case may be, even before the place of arbitration is determined). These articles are the following: articles 8 (1) and 9, which deal with the recognition of arbitration agreements, including their compatibility with interim measures ordered by a court, article 17 J on court-ordered interim measures, articles 17 H and 17 I on the recognition and enforcement of interim measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal, and articles 35 and 36 on the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.\\n\\n14. The territorial criterion governing most of the provisions of the Model Law was adopted for the sake of certainty and in view of the following facts. In most legal systems, the place of arbitration is the exclusive criterion for determining the applicability of national law and, where the national law allows parties to choose the procedural law of a State other than that where the arbitration takes place, experience shows that parties rarely make use of that possibility. Incidentally, enact- ment of the Model Law reduces any need for the parties to choose a “foreign” law, since the Model Law grants the parties wide freedom in shaping the rules of the arbitral proceedings. In addition to designating the law governing the arbitral procedure, the territorial criterion is of considerable practical importance in respect of articles 11, 13, 14, 16, 27 and 34, which entrust State courts at the place of\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\narbitration with functions of supervision and assistance to arbitration. It should be noted that the territorial criterion legally triggered by the parties’ choice regarding the place of arbitration does not limit the arbitral tribunal’s ability to meet at any place it considers appropriate for the conduct of the proceedings, as provided by article 20 (2).\\n\\n(b) Delimitation of court assistance and supervision\\n\\n15. Recent amendments to arbitration laws reveal a trend in favour of limiting and clearly deﬁ ning court involvement in international commercial arbitration. This is justiﬁ ed in view of the fact that the parties to an arbitration agreement make a conscious decision to exclude court jurisdiction and prefer the ﬁ nality and expedi- ency of the arbitral process.\\n\\n16. In this spirit, the Model Law envisages court involvement in the following instances. A ﬁ rst group comprises issues of appointment, challenge and termination of the mandate of an arbitrator (articles 11, 13 and 14), jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal (article 16) and setting aside of the arbitral award (article 34). These instances are listed in article 6 as functions that should be entrusted, for the sake of centralization, specialization and efﬁ ciency, to a specially designated court or, with respect to articles 11, 13 and 14, possibly to another authority (for example, an arbitral institution or a chamber of commerce). A second group comprises issues of court assistance in taking evidence (article 27), recognition of the arbitration agreement, including its compatibility with court-ordered interim measures (arti- cles 8 and 9), court-ordered interim measures (article 17 J), and recognition and enforcement of interim measures (articles 17 H and 17 I) and of arbitral awards (articles 35 and 36).\\n\\n17. Beyond the instances in these two groups, “no court shall intervene, in matters governed by this Law”. Article 5 thus guarantees that all instances of possible court intervention are found in the piece of legislation enacting the Model Law, except for matters not regulated by it (for example, consolidation of arbitral proceedings, contractual relationship between arbitrators and parties or arbitral institutions, or ﬁ xing of costs and fees, including deposits). Protecting the arbitral process from unpredictable or disruptive court interference is essential to parties who choose arbitration (in particular foreign parties).\\n\\n2. Arbitration agreement\\n\\n18. Chapter II of the Model Law deals with the arbitration agreement, including its recognition by courts.\\n\\n(a) Deﬁ nition and form of arbitration agreement\\n\\n19. The original 1985 version of the provision on the deﬁ nition and form of arbitration agreement (article 7) closely followed article II (2) of the New York\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nConvention, which requires that an arbitration agreement be in writing. If the parties have agreed to arbitrate, but they entered into the arbitration agreement in a manner that does not meet the form requirement, any party may have grounds to object to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. It was pointed out by practitioners that, in a number of situations, the drafting of a written document was impossible or impractical. In such cases, where the willingness of the parties to arbitrate was not in question, the validity of the arbitration agreement should be recognized. For that reason, article 7 was amended in 2006 to better conform to international contract practices. In amending article 7, the Commission adopted two options, which reﬂ ect two different approaches on the question of deﬁ nition and form of arbitration agree- ment. The ﬁ rst approach follows the detailed structure of the original 1985 text. It conﬁ rms the validity and effect of a commitment by the parties to submit to arbitra- tion an existing dispute (“compromis”) or a future dispute (“clause compromis- soire”). It follows the New York Convention in requiring the written form of the arbitration agreement but recognizes a record of the “contents” of the agreement “in any form” as equivalent to traditional “writing”. The agreement to arbitrate may be entered into in any form (e.g. including orally) as long as the content of the agreement is recorded. This new rule is signiﬁ cant in that it no longer requires signatures of the parties or an exchange of messages between the parties. It mod- ernizes the language referring to the use of electronic commerce by adopting word- ing inspired from the 1996 UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce and the 2005 United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. It covers the situation of “an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by another”. It also states that “the reference in a contract to any document” (for example, general conditions) “containing an arbitration clause con- stitutes an arbitration agreement in writing provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract”. It thus clariﬁ es that applicable contract law remains available to determine the level of consent necessary for a party to become bound by an arbitration agreement allegedly made “by reference”. The second approach deﬁ nes the arbitration agreement in a manner that omits any form requirement. No preference was expressed by the Commission in favour of either option I or II, both of which are offered for enacting States to consider, depending on their particular needs, and by reference to the legal context in which the Model Law is enacted, including the general contract law of the enacting State. Both op- tions are intended to preserve the enforceability of arbitration agreements under the New York Convention.\\n\\n20. In that respect, the Commission also adopted, at its thirty-ninth session in 2006, a “Recommendation regarding the interpretation of article II, paragraph 2, and article VII, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done in New York, 10 June 1958” (A/61/17, Annex 2).2 The General Assembly, in its resolution 61/33 of 4 December 2006 noted that “in connection with the modernization of articles of the Model Law, the promotion of a uniform interpretation and application of the Convention on the Recognition and 2Reproduced in Part Three hereafter.\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done in New York, 10 June 1958, is par- ticularly timely”. The Recommendation was drafted in recognition of the widening use of electronic commerce and enactments of domestic legislation as well as case law, which are more favourable than the New York Convention in respect of the form requirement governing arbitration agreements, arbitration proceedings, and the enforcement of arbitral awards. The Recommendation encourages States to apply article II (2) of the New York Convention “recognizing that the circumstances described therein are not exhaustive”. In addition, the Recommendation encourages States to adopt the revised article 7 of the Model Law. Both options of the revised article 7 establish a more favourable regime for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards than that provided under the New York Convention. By virtue of the “more favourable law provision” contained in article VII (1) of the New York Convention, the Recommendation clariﬁ es that “any interested party” should be allowed “to avail itself of rights it may have, under the law or treaties of the country where an arbitration agreement is sought to be relied upon, to seek recognition of the validity of such an arbitration agreement”.\\n\\n(b) Arbitration agreement and the courts\\n\\n21. Articles 8 and 9 deal with two important aspects of the complex relationship between the arbitration agreement and the resort to courts. Modelled on article II (3) of the New York Convention, article 8 (1) of the Model Law places any court under an obligation to refer the parties to arbitration if the court is seized with a claim on the same subject-matter unless it ﬁ nds that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The referral is dependent on a request, which a party may make not later than when submitting its ﬁ rst statement on the substance of the dispute. This provision, where adopted by a State enacting the Model Law, is by its nature binding only on the courts of that State. However, since article 8 is not limited in scope to agreements providing for arbitration to take place in the enacting State, it promotes the universal recognition and effect of international commercial arbitration agreements.\\n\\n22. Article 9 expresses the principle that any interim measures of protection that may be obtained from courts under their procedural law (for example, pre-award attachments) are compatible with an arbitration agreement. That provision is ulti- mately addressed to the courts of any State, insofar as it establishes the compatibility between interim measures possibly issued by any court and an arbitration agreement, irrespective of the place of arbitration. Wherever a request for interim measures may be made to a court, it may not be relied upon, under the Model Law, as a waiver or an objection against the existence or effect of the arbitration agreement.\\n\\n3. Composition of arbitral tribunal\\n\\n23. Chapter III contains a number of detailed provisions on appointment, challenge, termination of mandate and replacement of an arbitrator. The chapter illustrates the\\n\\n29\\n\\n30\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\ngeneral approach taken by the Model Law in eliminating difﬁ culties that arise from inappropriate or fragmentary laws or rules. First, the approach recognizes the free- dom of the parties to determine, by reference to an existing set of arbitration rules or by an ad hoc agreement, the procedure to be followed, subject to the fundamental requirements of fairness and justice. Secondly, where the parties have not exercised their freedom to lay down the rules of procedure or they have failed to cover a par- ticular issue, the Model Law ensures, by providing a set of suppletive rules, that the arbitration may commence and proceed effectively until the dispute is resolved.\\n\\n24. Where under any procedure, agreed upon by the parties or based upon the suppletive rules of the Model Law, difﬁ culties arise in the process of appointment, challenge or termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, articles 11, 13 and 14 provide for assistance by courts or other competent authorities designated by the enacting State. In view of the urgency of matters relating to the composition of the arbitral tribunal or its ability to function, and in order to reduce the risk and effect of any dilatory tactics, short time-periods are set and decisions rendered by courts or other authorities on such matters are not appealable.\\n\\n4. Jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal\\n\\n(a) Competence to rule on own jurisdiction\\n\\n25. Article 16 (1) adopts the two important (not yet generally recognized) prin- ciples of “Kompetenz-Kompetenz” and of separability or autonomy of the arbitration clause. “Kompetenz-Kompetenz” means that the arbitral tribunal may independently rule on the question of whether it has jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, without having to resort to a court. Separability means that an arbitration clause shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. As a consequence, a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. Detailed provisions in paragraph (2) require that any objections relating to the arbitrators’ jurisdiction be made at the earliest possible time.\\n\\n26. The competence of the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction (i.e. on the foundation, content and extent of its mandate and power) is, of course, subject to court control. Where the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, article 16 (3) allows for immediate court control in order to avoid waste of time and money. However, three procedural safeguards are added to reduce the risk and effect of dilatory tactics: short time-period for resort to court (30 days), court decision not appealable, and discretion of the arbitral tribunal to continue the proceedings and make an award while the matter is pending before the court. In those cases where the arbitral tribunal decides to combine its decision on jurisdic- tion with an award on the merits, judicial review on the question of jurisdiction is available in setting aside proceedings under article 34 or in enforcement proceedings under article 36.\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\n(b) Power to order interim measures and preliminary orders\\n\\n27. Chapter IV A on interim measures and preliminary orders was adopted by the Commission in 2006. It replaces article 17 of the original 1985 version of the Model Law. Section 1 provides a generic deﬁ nition of interim measures and sets out the conditions for granting such measures. An important innovation of the revision lies in the establishment (in section 4) of a regime for the recognition and enforcement of interim measures, which was modelled, as appropriate, on the regime for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards under articles 35 and 36 of the Model Law.\\n\\n28. Section 2 of chapter IV A deals with the application for, and conditions for the granting of, preliminary orders. Preliminary orders provide a means for preserv- ing the status quo until the arbitral tribunal issues an interim measure adopting or modifying the preliminary order. Article 17 B (1) provides that “a party may, without notice to any other party, make a request for an interim measure together with an application for a preliminary order directing a party not to frustrate the purpose of the interim measure requested”. Article 17 B (2) permits an arbitral tribunal to grant a preliminary order if “it considers that prior disclosure of the request for the interim measure to the party against whom it is directed risks frustrating the purpose of the measure”. Article 17 C contains carefully drafted safeguards for the party against whom the preliminary order is directed, such as prompt notiﬁ cation of the applica- tion for the preliminary order and of the preliminary order itself (if any), and an opportunity for that party to present its case “at the earliest practicable time”. In any event, a preliminary order has a maximum duration of twenty days and, while binding on the parties, is not subject to court enforcement and does not constitute an award. The term “preliminary order” is used to emphasize its limited nature.\\n\\n29. Section 3 sets out rules applicable to both preliminary orders and interim measures.\\n\\n30. Section 5 includes article 17 J on interim measures ordered by courts in support of arbitration, and provides that “a court shall have the same power of issuing an interim measure in relation to arbitration proceedings irrespective of whether their place is in the territory of the enacting State, as it has in relation to proceedings in courts”. That article has been added in 2006 to put it beyond any doubt that the existence of an arbitration agreement does not infringe on the powers of the competent court to issue interim measures and that the party to such an arbitration agreement is free to approach the court with a request to order interim measures.\\n\\n5. Conduct of arbitral proceedings\\n\\n31. Chapter V provides the legal framework for a fair and effective conduct of the arbitral proceedings. Article 18, which sets out fundamental requirements of proce- dural justice, and article 19 on the rights and powers to determine the rules of procedure, express principles that are central to the Model Law.\\n\\n31\\n\\n32\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n(a) Fundamental procedural rights of a party\\n\\n32. Article 18 embodies the principles that the parties shall be treated with equality and given a full opportunity of presenting their case. A number of provisions illus- trate those principles. For example, article 24 (1) provides that, unless the parties have agreed that no oral hearings be held for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, the arbitral tribunal shall hold such hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by a party. It should be noted that article 24 (1) deals only with the general entitlement of a party to oral hearings (as an alternative to proceedings conducted on the basis of documents and other materials) and not with the procedural aspects, such as the length, number or timing of hearings.\\n\\n33. Another illustration of those principles relates to evidence by an expert appointed by the arbitral tribunal. Article 26 (2) requires the expert, after delivering his or her written or oral report, to participate in a hearing where the parties may put questions to the expert and present expert witnesses to testify on the points at issue, if such a hearing is requested by a party or deemed necessary by the arbitral tribunal. As another provision aimed at ensuring fairness, objectivity and impartial- ity, article 24 (3) provides that all statements, documents and other information supplied to the arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated to the other party, and that any expert report or evidentiary document on which the arbitral tri- bunal may rely in making its decision shall be communicated to the parties. In order to enable the parties to be present at any hearing and at any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for inspection purposes, they shall be given sufﬁ cient notice in advance (article 24 (2)). (b) Determination of rules of procedure\\n\\n34. Article 19 guarantees the parties’ freedom to agree on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings, subject to a few mandatory provisions on procedure, and empowers the arbitral tribunal, failing agreement by the parties, to conduct the arbitration in such a manner as it considers appropriate. The power conferred upon the arbitral tribunal includes the power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.\\n\\n35. Autonomy of the parties in determining the rules of procedure is of special importance in international cases since it allows the parties to select or tailor the rules according to their speciﬁ c wishes and needs, unimpeded by traditional and possibly conﬂ icting domestic concepts, thus obviating the earlier mentioned risk of frustration or surprise (see above, paras. 7 and 9). The supplementary discretion of the arbitral tribunal is equally important in that it allows the tribunal to tailor the conduct of the proceedings to the speciﬁ c features of the case without being hindered by any restraint that may stem from traditional local law, including any domestic rule on evidence. Moreover, it provides grounds for displaying initiative in solving any procedural question not regulated in the arbitration agreement or the Model Law.\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\n36. In addition to the general provisions of article 19, other provisions in the Model Law recognize party autonomy and, failing agreement, empower the arbitral tribunal to decide on certain matters. Examples of particular practical importance in international cases are article 20 on the place of arbitration and article 22 on the language to be used in the proceedings.\\n\\n(c) Default of a party\\n\\n37. The arbitral proceedings may be continued in the absence of a party, provided that due notice has been given. This applies, in particular, to the failure of the respondent to communicate its statement of defence (article 25 (b)). The arbitral tribunal may also continue the proceedings where a party fails to appear at a hear- ing or to produce documentary evidence without showing sufﬁ cient cause for the failure (article 25 (c)). However, if the claimant fails to submit its statement of claim, the arbitral tribunal is obliged to terminate the proceedings (article 25 (a)).\\n\\n38. Provisions that empower the arbitral tribunal to carry out its task even if one of the parties does not participate are of considerable practical importance. As experience shows, it is not uncommon for one of the parties to have little interest in cooperating or expediting matters. Such provisions therefore provide international commercial arbitration its necessary effectiveness, within the limits of fundamental requirements of procedural justice.\\n\\n6. Making of award and termination of proceedings\\n\\n(a) Rules applicable to substance of dispute\\n\\n39. Article 28 deals with the determination of the rules of law governing the substance of the dispute. Under paragraph (1), the arbitral tribunal decides the dis- pute in accordance with the rules of law chosen by the parties. This provision is signiﬁ cant in two respects. It grants the parties the freedom to choose the applicable substantive law, which is important where the national law does not clearly or fully recognize that right. In addition, by referring to the choice of “rules of law” instead of “law”, the Model Law broadens the range of options available to the parties as regards the designation of the law applicable to the substance of the dispute. For example, parties may agree on rules of law that have been elaborated by an inter- national forum but have not yet been incorporated into any national legal system. Parties could also choose directly an instrument such as the United Nations Conven- tion on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods as the body of substantive law governing the arbitration, without having to refer to the national law of any State party to that Convention. The power of the arbitral tribunal, on the other hand, follows more traditional lines. When the parties have not chosen the applicable law, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law (i.e., the national law) determined by the conﬂ ict-of-laws rules that it considers applicable.\\n\\n33\\n\\n34\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n40. Article 28 (3) recognizes that the parties may authorize the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute ex aequo et bono or as amiables compositeur. This type of arbi- tration (where the arbitral tribunal may decide the dispute on the basis of principles it believes to be just, without having to refer to any particular body of law) is cur- rently not known or used in all legal systems. The Model Law does not intend to regulate this area. It simply calls the attention of the parties on the need to provide clariﬁ cation in the arbitration agreement and speciﬁ cally to empower the arbitral tribunal. However, paragraph (4) makes it clear that in all cases where the dispute relates to a contract (including arbitration ex aequo et bono) the arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction. (b) Making of award and other decisions\\n\\n41. In its rules on the making of the award (articles 29-31), the Model Law focuses on the situation where the arbitral tribunal consists of more than one arbitrator. In such a situation, any award and other decision shall be made by a majority of the arbitrators, except on questions of procedure, which may be left to a presiding arbitrator. The majority principle applies also to the signing of the award, provided that the reason for any omitted signature is stated.\\n\\n42. Article 31 (3) provides that the award shall state the place of arbitration and shall be deemed to have been made at that place. The effect of the deeming provi- sion is to emphasize that the ﬁ nal making of the award constitutes a legal act, which in practice does not necessarily coincide with one factual event. For the same reason that the arbitral proceedings need not be carried out at the place designated as the legal “place of arbitration”, the making of the award may be completed through deliberations held at various places, by telephone or correspondence. In addition, the award does not have to be signed by the arbitrators physically gathering at the same place.\\n\\n43. The arbitral award must be in writing and state its date. It must also state the reasons on which it is based, unless the parties have agreed otherwise or the award is “on agreed terms” (i.e., an award that records the terms of an amicable settlement by the parties). It may be added that the Model Law neither requires nor prohibits “dissenting opinions”.\\n\\n7. Recourse against award\\n\\n44. The disparity found in national laws as regards the types of recourse against an arbitral award available to the parties presents a major difﬁ culty in harmonizing international arbitration legislation. Some outdated laws on arbitration, by establish- ing parallel regimes for recourse against arbitral awards or against court decisions, provide various types of recourse, various (and often long) time periods for exercis- ing the recourse, and extensive lists of grounds on which recourse may be based.\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\nThat situation (of considerable concern to those involved in international commercial arbitration) is greatly improved by the Model Law, which provides uniform grounds upon which (and clear time periods within which) recourse against an arbitral award may be made.\\n\\n(a) Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse\\n\\n45. The ﬁ rst measure of improvement is to allow only one type of recourse, to the exclusion of any other recourse regulated in any procedural law of the State in question. Article 34 (1) provides that the sole recourse against an arbitral award is by application for setting aside, which must be made within three months of receipt of the award (article 34 (3)). In regulating “recourse” (i.e., the means through which a party may actively “attack” the award), article 34 does not preclude a party from seeking court control by way of defence in enforcement proceedings (articles 35 and 36). Article 34 is limited to action before a court (i.e., an organ of the judicial system of a State). However, a party is not precluded from appealing to an arbitral tribunal of second instance if the parties have agreed on such a possibility (as is common in certain commodity trades). (b) Grounds for setting aside\\n\\n46. As a further measure of improvement, the Model Law lists exhaustively the grounds on which an award may be set aside. This list essentially mirrors that contained in article 36 (1), which is taken from article V of the New York Conven- tion. The grounds provided in article 34 (2) are set out in two categories. Grounds which are to be proven by one party are as follows: lack of capacity of the parties to conclude an arbitration agreement; lack of a valid arbitration agreement; lack of notice of appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or inability of a party to present its case; the award deals with matters not covered by the submis- sion to arbitration; the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the conduct of arbitral proceedings are contrary to the effective agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, to the Model Law. Grounds that a court may consider of its own initia- tive are as follows: non-arbitrability of the subject-matter of the dispute or violation of public policy (which is to be understood as serious departures from fundamental notions of procedural justice).\\n\\n47. The approach under which the grounds for setting aside an award under the Model Law parallel the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement of the award under article V of the New York Convention is reminiscent of the approach taken in the European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration (Geneva, 1961). Under article IX of the latter Convention, the decision of a foreign court to set aside an award for a reason other than the ones listed in article V of the New York Convention does not constitute a ground for refusing enforcement. The Model Law takes this philosophy one step further by directly limiting the reasons for setting aside.\\n\\n35\\n\\n36\\n\\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\n48. Although the grounds for setting aside as set out in article 34 (2) are almost identical to those for refusing recognition or enforcement as set out in article 36 (1), a practical difference should be noted. An application for setting aside under arti- cle 34 (2) may only be made to a court in the State where the award was rendered whereas an application for enforcement might be made in a court in any State. For that reason, the grounds relating to public policy and non-arbitrability may vary in substance with the law applied by the court (in the State of setting aside or in the State of enforcement).\\n\\n8. Recognition and enforcement of awards\\n\\n49. The eighth and last chapter of the Model Law deals with the recognition and enforcement of awards. Its provisions reﬂ ect the signiﬁ cant policy decision that the same rules should apply to arbitral awards whether made in the country of enforce- ment or abroad, and that those rules should follow closely the New York Convention.\\n\\n(a) Towards uniform treatment of all awards irrespective of country of origin\\n\\n50. By treating awards rendered in international commercial arbitration in a uni- form manner irrespective of where they were made, the Model Law distinguishes between “international” and “non-international” awards instead of relying on the traditional distinction between “foreign” and “domestic” awards. This new line is based on substantive grounds rather than territorial borders, which are inappropriate in view of the limited importance of the place of arbitration in international cases. The place of arbitration is often chosen for reasons of convenience of the parties and the dispute may have little or no connection with the State where the arbitration legally takes place. Consequently, the recognition and enforcement of “international” awards, whether “foreign” or “domestic”, should be governed by the same provisions.\\n\\n51. By modelling the recognition and enforcement rules on the relevant provisions of the New York Convention, the Model Law supplements, without conﬂ icting with, the regime of recognition and enforcement created by that successful Convention.\\n\\n(b) Procedural conditions of recognition and enforcement\\n\\n52. Under article 35 (1) any arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, shall be recognized as binding and enforceable, subject to the provi- sions of article 35 (2) and of article 36 (the latter of which sets forth the grounds on which recognition or enforcement may be refused). Based on the above consid- eration of the limited importance of the place of arbitration in international cases and the desire of overcoming territorial restrictions, reciprocity is not included as a condition for recognition and enforcement.\\n\\nPart Two. Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL secretariat\\n\\n53. The Model Law does not lay down procedural details of recognition and enforcement, which are left to national procedural laws and practices. The Model Law merely sets certain conditions for obtaining enforcement under article 35 (2). It was amended in 2006 to liberalize formal requirements and reﬂ ect the amendment made to article 7 on the form of the arbitration agreement. Presentation of a copy of the arbitration agreement is no longer required under article 35 (2).\\n\\n(c) Grounds for refusing recognition or enforcement\\n\\n54. Although the grounds on which recognition or enforcement may be refused under the Model Law are identical to those listed in article V of the New York Convention, the grounds listed in the Model Law are relevant not only to foreign awards but to all awards rendered in the sphere of application of the piece of leg- islation enacting the Model Law. Generally, it was deemed desirable to adopt, for the sake of harmony, the same approach and wording as this important Convention. However, the ﬁ rst ground on the list as contained in the New York Convention (which provides that recognition and enforcement may be refused if “the parties to the arbitration agreement were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity”) was modiﬁ ed since it was viewed as containing an incomplete and potentially misleading conﬂ ict-of-laws rule.

The Arbitration and Conciliation\\n\\nAct, Cap. 4 was enacted to regulate the operation of arbitration and conciliation\\n\\nprocedures, as well as the behavior of the arbitrator or conciliator in the conduct of such\\n\\nprocedure. The Act is largely based on the 1985 United Nations Commission on\\n\\nInternational Trade (UNCITRAL) model law on International Commercial Arbitration\\n\\nas well as the UNICITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976. The model law was amended in\\n\\n2006 to address evolving practices in international arbitration with regard to the form of\\n\\narbitration agreements and interim measures.\\n\\nThe Uganda Law Reform Commission (Commission) with support of the Justice Law\\n\\nand Order Sector (JLOS) is undertaking a study to review and reform the Arbitration\\n\\nand Conciliation Act, 2000. The review is intended to update the law, establish the gaps\\n\\nif any in the law, address challenges faced in the implementation of the Act and make\\n\\nproposals for amendment.\\n\\n3\\n\\n1.1 Background\\n\\nDispute resolution mechanisms have constantly undergone continuous transformation\\n\\nthroughout the history of commercial conflicts. The processes of litigation have been\\n\\nacknowledged to prove grossly inadequate and prone to more damage than resolution\\n\\nof conflict by hampering positive future relation and association between the parties to\\n\\nit. In modern commercial contracts, the parties have a choice to determine what dispute\\n\\nprocedures to adopt.1 Consequently, arbitration has shown to be the most widely\\n\\nembraced process for business disputes especially across national borders and\\n\\nboundaries.\\n\\nIn Uganda ,the first enactment of the law governing arbitration was the Arbitration\\n\\nAct, Cap 55 of 1964 subsequently ; the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap. 4 was\\n\\nenacted in 2000 to amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, international\\n\\ncommercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, to define the law\\n\\nrelating to conciliation of disputes and to make other provision relating to arbitration\\n\\nand conciliation matters. In 2008, the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act\\n\\nNo.3 of 2008 was enacted to specifically provide for the funding of the Centre for\\n\\nArbitration and Dispute Resolution by Government.\\n\\nArbitration is defined as the investigation and determination of a matter or matters of\\n\\ndifference between contending parties, by one or more unofficial persons, chosen by the\\n\\n1 Earl S. Wolaver ‘The Historical Background of Commercial Arbitration, 83 U. Pa. L. Rev. 132 (1934). Available at: http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol83/iss2/2\\n\\n4\\n\\nparties, and called “arbitrators,” or “referees.”2.3 As a dispute resolution mechanism,\\n\\narbitration has long gained prominence among governments and inter/multinational\\n\\norganisations, for instance most contracts now contain clauses that mandate parties to\\n\\nexplore arbitration options in the event of a disagreement. In general terms, arbitration\\n\\nis a consensual process in which a binding decision is taken by a privately appointed\\n\\ndecision maker in accordance with neutral procedures that give each party the\\n\\nopportunity for a fair hearing and to present its case to the arbitrator(s)4.\\n\\nParties generally opt for arbitration and agree to refer disputes to arbitration as a matter\\n\\nof contract. Due to the consensual nature of arbitration, the agreement to arbitrate is\\n\\ntypically central to the conduct of arbitration. An arbitral agreement defines what\\n\\ndisputes the arbitrators have the power or jurisdiction to determine and what\\n\\narbitration rules will apply.5\\n\\nIn cases of international arbitration, the arbitral agreement will stipulate the seat or\\n\\nlegal place of the arbitration. Parties often agree to arbitrate under a set of arbitration\\n\\nrules. The growth of international arbitration can be attributed to the expansion in\\n\\ninternational trade and commerce. Part of the growth, however, is attributed to the\\n\\n2 Black’s Law Dictionary 2nd Edition\\n\\n3 Wuraola O. Durosaro ‘The Role of Arbitration in International Commercial Disputes’ Iinternational Journal of Humanities Social Sciences and Education (IJHSSE) Volume 1, Issue 3, March 2014, PP 1-8. www.arcjournals.org\\n\\n4 Steven P. Finizio and Duncan Speller, ‘A practical guide to international commercial arbitration: Assessment, planning and strategy’ Thomson Reuters 2010\\n\\n5 Section 3of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act ,Cap.4\\n\\n5\\n\\nrelative attractiveness of international arbitration as a means of resolving commercial\\n\\ndisputes between parties of different nationalities.6\\n\\nArbitration has thus gained popularity over time amongst the business community due\\n\\nto its advantages over litigation. One of the most outstanding benefits of arbitration\\n\\nover litigation is its transnational applicability in international disputes with minimal or\\n\\nno interference by the national courts, thus boosting the parties confidence of realizing\\n\\njustice in the best way achievable.\\n\\nFurther, it has been observed that among the primary advantages of international\\n\\narbitration are its finality and the relative ease of enforcement of arbitral awards\\n\\nthroughout the world. Countries and various regions around the world have thus\\n\\nembarked on promoting international arbitration as the best dispute settlement\\n\\napproach in international disputes. It is in this recognition of international arbitration as\\n\\none of the most viable approaches to international disputes management that\\n\\nstructures/institutions for arbitration are being established across the continent.\\n\\nConciliation on the other hand; is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process\\n\\nwhereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties both\\n\\nseparately and together in an attempt to resolve their differences and then issues a non-\\n\\nbinding suggested resolution7. Parties go through the conciliation process by lowering\\n\\ntensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, encouraging parties to\\n\\n6 Steven P. Finizio and Duncan Speller, ‘A practical guide to international commercial arbitration: Assessment, planning and strategy’ Thomson Reuters 2010 7 Duhaime’s Law Dictionary, http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/Conciliation.aspx as acessed on 28th February, 2017.\\n\\n6\\n\\nexplore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable\\n\\noutcome.\\n\\nConciliation differs from arbitration in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has\\n\\nno legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call\\n\\nwitnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award.\\n\\nThe 1985 United Nations Commission on International Trade (UNCITRAL) model law\\n\\non International Commercial Arbitration as well as the UNICITRAL Arbitration Rules\\n\\n1976 on which the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Cap. 4) was\\n\\nlargely based was amended in 2006. The model law is intended to provide a uniform\\n\\nstandard when developing national legislation on international commercial arbitration.\\n\\nUganda which adopted the model law in 2000 and extended its scope of application to\\n\\ncover domestic arbitrations needs to ensure that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act\\n\\n(Cap. 4) conforms to the international uniform standards stipulated in the 2006\\n\\n(UNCITRAL) model law. This will enhance Uganda as one of the most sought out\\n\\narbitration seat in the world.\\n\\n1.2 Statement of the problem\\n\\nCurrently, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Cap. 4) does not provide for the\\n\\nimmunity of an arbitrator. The lack of immunity would cause fear of liability for\\n\\ndecisions that could have been made out of improper interpretation of the law. Having\\n\\na law that supports an arbitrator’s immunity ensures the efficient and speedy\\n\\nadministration of justice.\\n\\n7\\n\\nThe definition and form of arbitration agreement in the law is inadequate. The\\n\\ndefinition does not take into consideration electronic communication that the parties\\n\\nmake by means of data message. With the technological advancement, this definition\\n\\nshould cover all the different forms of communication that have since developed since\\n\\nthe enactment of the Act sixteen years ago.\\n\\nThe provisions relating to interim measures and preliminary orders in the Act refer a\\n\\nparty to court during the proceeding. This disregards the spirit of arbitration where\\n\\nsuch matters should be restricted to the arbitral tribunal.\\n\\nIt pertinent therefore that the law on arbitration and conciliation address the challenges\\n\\nand the gaps identified to ensure that the legislation is robust to handle both domestic\\n\\nand international disputes where arbitration and conciliation is resorted to as an\\n\\nalternative dispute resolution mechanism for commercial investments and business in\\n\\nUganda and globally.\\n\\n1.3 Justification of the study\\n\\nWith increased globalization, arbitration has become the preferred mechanism for\\n\\nsettling international disputes. Although Uganda adopted a huge number of provisions\\n\\nof the 1985 UNCITRAL model law and rules there under, UNCITRAL has since\\n\\namended several provisions to cater for changing times in technology and to promote\\n\\ninternational commercial arbitration. Uganda on the other hand has not moved with the\\n\\nchanges made by the UNCITRAL model law and the consequence of not taking into\\n\\n8\\n\\nconsideration the changing times could affect international investment and business in\\n\\nUganda. There is need to strengthen our law to ensure that Uganda becomes a\\n\\ncompetitive arbitral destination for international disputes.\\n\\n1.4 Objectives of the study\\n\\nThe main objective of the study is to review and examine the adequacy of the\\n\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act to ensure effective and efficient arbitration and\\n\\nconciliation procedures and promote Uganda as the leading choice for international\\n\\ncommercial arbitration.\\n\\nThe study shall be guided by the following specific objectives;\\n\\ni)\\n\\nidentify the gaps in the legal framework with reference to the exiting legal\\n\\nregimes that are relevant to arbitration and conciliation with the view to bridging\\n\\nthe gaps;\\n\\nii) explore solutions and proposals aimed at addressing the current challenges such\\n\\ninterim measure and immunity of arbitrators among others;\\n\\niii) identify international best and next practices on arbitration and conciliation\\n\\nprocedures;\\n\\n1.5 Scope of the study\\n\\nThe study is intended to cover aspects arbitration and conciliation in particular the\\n\\nstudy will cover the following issues-:\\n\\n9\\n\\ni) ascertain whether immunity should be granted to arbitrators to ensure efficient\\n\\nand speedy administration of justice and the promotion of the practice of\\n\\ninternational commercial arbitration in Uganda;\\n\\nii) to expand the definition and form of arbitration agreement to cater for electronic\\n\\ncommunication and other growing technological mechanisms in international\\n\\ncommercial law; and\\n\\niii) to provide for comprehensive provisions on interim and preliminary orders in\\n\\narbitration in Uganda.\\n\\n1.6 Methodology\\n\\nThe method adopted to undertake this study is the qualitative research method. This\\n\\nmethod will be used to generate and establish a detailed description of the arbitration\\n\\nand conciliation as a form of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and enable a\\n\\ndeeper understating of the issues affecting this area and the need for reform.\\n\\nThe following qualitative techniques will be used for data and information collection\\n\\nduring the study. Documented sources from within Uganda and other jurisdictions will\\n\\nbe reviewed, the views, opinions and proposals of selected key stakeholders on the\\n\\nsubject of arbitration and conciliation as an alternative dispute mechanism will be\\n\\nconsulted through technical working meetings, key informant interviews and bench\\n\\nmarking exercise will be carried out in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nAs the study progress the Commission will seek to consult and gather views and feed\\n\\nback on issues highlighted in this paper. Among the institutions as key to this study\\n\\n10\\n\\ninclude; Centre for Arbitration & Dispute Resolution (CADER), the Commercial\\n\\nDivision of the High Court, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Uganda\\n\\nNational Oil Company, legal practitioners, Academia and the London Court of\\n\\nInternational Arbitration in the UK.\\n\\n11\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO\\n\\nISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION\\n\\n2.0 Introduction\\n\\nThis part provides for an in-depth analysis into the issues under review. The analysis is\\n\\nbased on literature reviewed.\\n\\n2.1 Immunity of Arbitrators\\n\\nImmunity from suit is clearly a prerogative reserved to the State. In affording\\n\\narbitrators with immunity, the State will weigh the wrong such immunity can cause\\n\\nagainst the benefits distilled from the public policy reasons to find that the concession is\\n\\nworthwhile8. Arbitrators are individuals whom the legal system permits to perform a\\n\\nfunction that is in principle reserved to the State. In further extending this concession to,\\n\\ninter alia employees, agents and advisors , excluding this immunity , it would most\\n\\nlikely influence parties to choose other jurisdictions as their seat of arbitration, where\\n\\ntheir immunity is not circumscribed 9.\\n\\nAn arbitrator in his position has moved from one where it was considered prudent to\\n\\nhold a professional insurance policy so as to protect from risk against any possible\\n\\n8 The Principle of Arbitrator Immunity ; accessed on 3/3/2017 https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law- essays/commercial-law/the-principle-of-arbitrator-immunity-commercial-law-essay.php\\n\\n9 Ibid\\n\\n12\\n\\nchanges in the law on the one hand, to blanket immunity on the other. From the point\\n\\nof the unsuccessful litigant however, it can be argued that they are now faced with an\\n\\narbitrator armed with a charter for incompetents, who lacks elementary skill, increases\\n\\ncosts and delay, and can now carry on in that regard without fear of litigation.10 Thus\\n\\ninstead of providing a positive motivation to those considering arbitration, it can be\\n\\nargued that the extension of immunity may in fact amount to a turn off.\\n\\nWhat is certain though is that the model, which adheres to the best international\\n\\npractice laid down by the UNICTRAL has the potential to help attract international\\n\\narbitration business and create a centre of excellence for international arbitration,\\n\\narguably something which the common law provision could not. In the leading case of\\n\\nSutcliffe v. Thakra11, Lord Salmon stated that it is well settled that judges, barristers,\\n\\nsolicitors, enjoy an absolute immunity from any form of civil action being brought\\n\\nagainst them in respect of anything they say or do in court during the course of a trial.\\n\\nThis presumption should be equally applied to arbitrators on the grounds of public\\n\\npolicy.\\n\\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act is silent on the immunity of an arbitrator which is\\n\\ncovered under the UNCITRAL Model law, the lack of immunity would cause fear of\\n\\nliability for decisions that could have been made out of improper interpretation of the\\n\\nlaw. Jurisdictions such as the UK, USA, and Singapore have all laws supporting an\\n\\n10 Jenny Brown; Expansion of Arbitral Immunity: Is Absolute Immunity a Foregone Conclusion Journal of Dispute Resolution Volume 2009|Issue 1 Article Page 227 11 [1974] A.C. 727 et seq.\\n\\n13\\n\\narbitrator’s immunity for efficient and speedy administration of justice which is needed\\n\\non the ground of public policy.12\\n\\nIssue for consideration\\n\\nShould the Act be amended to provide for immunity of an arbitrator against matters\\n\\nthat they have presided over?\\n\\n2.2 Limitations concerning Interim and Preliminary measures\\n\\nThe availability and handling of interim measures in international commercial\\n\\narbitration has become one of the main issues in developing a legal setup for\\n\\narbitration. In arbitration, the availability or otherwise of provisional measures can have\\n\\na substantial effect on the final result, especially when issues relating to protection of\\n\\nevidence and assets arise before or during the course of the proceedings.13\\n\\nA report submitted by the UN Secretary General on settlement of commercial disputes\\n\\nclearly outlines the importance of interim measures and also the growing need for\\n\\ninterim relief from the tribunals, among the parties14. As arbitration moves into fields\\n\\nlike environmental disputes and intellectual property, where quick decision could mean\\n\\n12 Rules supporting immunity of arbitrators, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules, International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Arbitration Rules, WIPO Arbitration Rules, London Court of arbitration Rules, etc.\\n\\n13Sandeep Adhipathi ; Interim Measures in International Commercial Arbitration: Past, Present and Future (2003).

In the report,\\n\\nthe Secretary General also notes the various legislations and amendments that have\\n\\nbeen made by the nations and also in the model law16. The three main issues when\\n\\ndealing with interim measures in arbitration are power of the courts to grant interim\\n\\norders, power of the arbitrators to order interim relief and the possibility of\\n\\nenforcement of interim orders granted by the tribunal.\\n\\nThe push towards interim measures has not been without criticism. The major\\n\\nargument against interim relief is that being a contractual relationship, there is no need\\n\\nfor interim relief. Also, the critics point out that more than 80% of awards are executed\\n\\nwithout any problem and the provisional measures will only serve as a tool to delay the\\n\\nprocedure. Another major concern for many is the tribunal’s lack of power to enforce its\\n\\ninterim orders17.\\n\\nIn Uganda, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act under section 6 provides that a party to\\n\\nan arbitration agreement may apply to the court before or during arbitral proceedings,\\n\\nfor an interim measure of protection and the court may grant that measure. The spirit of\\n\\narbitration is that all proceedings should be carried out in the tribunal for quick relief.\\n\\nInvolving court for interim measures during arbitration proceedings may cause\\n\\nunnecessary delays which the parties tried to avoid when they chose to arbitrate.

This depends on whether certain parties have agreed to have certain disputes\\n\\nbetween them resolved through arbitration; thus, there is potentially, in any dispute, a\\n\\nquestion of whether the parties did agree to arbitrate and how the issue should be\\n\\nresolved.\\n\\nIn Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. vs. SBI Home Finance Ltd. & Ors., 19 the supreme court\\n\\ncarved out six categories of cases which are not capable for being decided by private\\n\\narbitration even though parties agreed for their settlement through private arbitration\\n\\nnamely; (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of\\n\\ncriminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation,\\n\\nrestitution of conjugal child custody; (iii) guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and\\n\\nwinding up matters; (v) testamentary matters (grant of probate, letters of administration\\n\\nBaker McKenzie Who decides arbitrability? http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.accessed on 3/02/17\\n\\n18 19 (2011) 5 SCC 532\\n\\n16\\n\\nand succession certificate); and (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special\\n\\nstatutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction. The supreme\\n\\ncourt of India in Shri Vimal Kishor Shah Vs Jayesh Dinesh Shah & Ors20 has also\\n\\nadded one more category in the list (vii), namely, cases arising out of Trust Deed and\\n\\nthe trust act.\\n\\nIn Uganda, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act is silent on matters which can or cannot\\n\\nbe taken for arbitration. The study will seek to explore how the above mentioned\\n\\ncategories of cases are applicable in Uganda basing on the prevailing circumstances of\\n\\ncorruption, case backlog in the courts of law and the fact that there is only one Centre\\n\\nfor Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.\\n\\nIssue for consideration\\n\\nWhat disputes should arbitrators have the power and jurisdiction to determine?\\n\\n2.4 Definition and form of arbitration agreement\\n\\nAn arbitration agreement is a written contract in which two or more parties agree to\\n\\nsettle a dispute outside of court. The arbitration agreement is ordinarily a clause in a\\n\\nlarger contract21. Parties are free to agree to use arbitration concerning anything\\n\\nthat they could otherwise resolve through legal proceedings. An arbitration agreement\\n\\ncan be as simple as a provision in a contract stating that by signing that contract a party\\n\\nis agreeing to arbitration in the case of any future disputes.\\n\\n20 SCCA of India No.8164 of 2016\\n\\n21 What is an arbitration agreement? http://law.freeadvice.com/litigation/arbitration/agreement_arbitration.htm\\n\\n17\\n\\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act under section 2(c) defines an arbitration\\n\\nagreement as an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain dispute\\n\\nwhich have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal\\n\\nrelationship , whether contractual or not. The definition of an agreement under\\n\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act was based on the model law of 1985 which has since\\n\\nbeen amended. The new definition takes into consideration among others the form and\\n\\nhas broadened the means of communication to include electronic communication that\\n\\nthe parties make by means of data message. This definition is all inclusive and has\\n\\ntaken care of the new forms of communication that have since evolved and there is a\\n\\nneed to incorporate it in our law to make such agreements effective.\\n\\nIssue for consideration\\n\\nWhether the definition an arbitration agreement should be amended to incorporate\\n\\nthe new forms of communication?\\n\\n18\\n\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n\\nDomestic Legislation\\n\\n1.

The Convention was formulated by the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank). On March 18, 1965, the Executive Directors submitted the Convention, with an accompanying Report, to member governments of the World Bank for their consideration of the Convention with a view to its signature and ratification. The Convention entered into force on October 14, 1966, when it had been ratified by 20 countries. As at April 10, 2006, 143 countries have ratified the Convention to become Contracting States.\\n\\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Convention, ICSID pro- vides facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States. The provisions of the ICSID Convention are complemented by Regula- tions and Rules adopted by the Administrative Council of the Centre pursuant to Article 6(1)(a)–(c) of the Convention (the ICSID Regula- tions and Rules).\\n\\nThe ICSID Regulations and Rules comprise Administrative and Financial Regulations; Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Concilia- tion and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules); Rules of Procedure for Conciliation Proceedings (Conciliation Rules); and Rules of Proce- dure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules). The latest amend- ments of the ICSID Regulations and Rules adopted by the Administrative Council of the Centre came into effect on April 10, 2006.\\n\\nReprinted in this booklet are the ICSID Convention, the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank on the Convention, and the ICSID Regulations and Rules as amended effective April 10, 2006.\\n\\n5\\n\\nCONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF OTHER STATES\\n\\n7\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\nChapter\\n\\nI\\n\\nII\\n\\nIII\\n\\nIV\\n\\nV\\n\\nVI\\n\\nVII\\n\\nCONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF OTHER STATES\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nSection\\n\\nArticles\\n\\nPreamble\\n\\n1 2 3 4 5 6\\n\\nInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes 1-24 1-3 Establishment and Organization 4-8 The Administrative Council 9-11 The Secretariat 12-16 The Panels 17 Financing the Centre 18-24 Status, Immunities and Privileges\\n\\nJurisdiction of the Centre\\n\\n25-27\\n\\n1 2\\n\\n3\\n\\nConciliation Request for Conciliation Constitution of the Conciliation Commission Conciliation Proceedings\\n\\n28-35 28\\n\\n29-31 32-35\\n\\n1 2 3\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n6\\n\\nArbitration Request for Arbitration Constitution of the Tribunal Powers and Functions of the Tribunal The Award Interpretation, Revision and Annulment of the Award Recognition and Enforcement of the Award\\n\\n36-55 36 37-40\\n\\n41-47 48-49\\n\\n50-52\\n\\n53-55\\n\\nReplacement and Disqualification of Conciliators and Arbitrators\\n\\n56-58\\n\\nCost of Proceedings\\n\\n59-61\\n\\nPlace of Proceedings\\n\\n62-63\\n\\nPage\\n\\n11\\n\\n12 12 12 14 15 16 16\\n\\n18\\n\\n19 19\\n\\n20 20\\n\\n22 22 22\\n\\n23 25\\n\\n25\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\n29\\n\\n30\\n\\n9\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nIX\\n\\nX\\n\\n10\\n\\nDisputes Between Contracting States\\n\\nAmendment\\n\\nFinal Provisions\\n\\nSignature Clause\\n\\n64\\n\\n65-66\\n\\n67-75\\n\\n30\\n\\n30\\n\\n31\\n\\n33\\n\\nCONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF OTHER STATES\\n\\nPreamble\\n\\nThe Contracting States\\n\\nConsidering the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein; Bearing in mind the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States;\\n\\nRecognizing that while such disputes would usually be subject to national legal processes, international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases;\\n\\nAttaching particular importance to the availability of facilities for international conciliation or arbitration to which Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States may submit such disputes if they so desire;\\n\\nDesiring to establish such facilities under the auspices of the Inter-\\n\\nnational Bank for Reconstruction and Development;\\n\\nRecognizing that mutual consent by the parties to submit such dis- putes to conciliation or to arbitration through such facilities constitutes a binding agreement which requires in particular that due considera- tion be given to any recommendation of conciliators, and that any arbi- tral award be complied with; and\\n\\nDeclaring that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its rat- ification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration,\\n\\nHave agreed as follows:\\n\\n11\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nChapter I International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\\n\\nSection 1 Establishment and Organization\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\n(1) There is hereby established the International Centre for Settle-\\n\\nment of Investment Disputes (hereinafter called the Centre).\\n\\n(2) The purpose of the Centre shall be to provide facilities for con- ciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\nThe seat of the Centre shall be at the principal office of the Inter- national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter called the Bank).

Resolution No. 214, adopted by the Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on September 10, 1964, provides as follows: “RESOLVED: (a) The report of the Executive Directors on “Settlement of Investment Disputes,” dated August 6, 1964, is hereby approved. (b) The Executive Directors are requested to formulate a con- vention establishing facilities and procedures which would be available on a voluntary basis for the settlement of investment disputes between contracting States and Nationals of other contracting States through conciliation and arbitration.\\n\\n(c) In formulating such a convention, the Executive Directors shall take into account the views of member governments and shall keep in mind the desirability of arriving at a text which could be accepted by the largest possible number of governments.\\n\\n(d) The Executive Directors shall submit the text of such a con- vention to member governments with such recommenda- tions as they shall deem appropriate.”\\n\\n2. The Executive Directors of the Bank, acting pursuant to the foregoing Resolution, have formulated a Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and, on March 18, 1965, approved the submission of the text of the Convention, as attached hereto, to member governments of the Bank. This action by the Executive Directors does not, of course, imply that the governments represented by the individual Executive Directors are committed to take action on the Convention.\\n\\n3. The action by the Executive Directors was preceded by exten- sive preparatory work, details of which are given in paragraphs 6-8 below. The Executive Directors are satisfied that the Convention in the form attached hereto represents a broad consensus of the views of those governments which accept the principle of establishing by inter-gov-\\n\\n38\\n\\nernmental agreement facilities and procedures for the settlement of investment disputes which States and foreign investors wish to submit to conciliation or arbitration. They are also satisfied that the Conven- tion constitutes a suitable framework for such facilities and procedures. Accordingly, the text of the Convention is submitted to member gov- ernments for consideration with a view to signature and ratification, acceptance or approval.\\n\\n4. The Executive Directors invite attention to the provision of Article 68(2) pursuant to which the Convention will enter into force as between the Contracting States 30 days after deposit with the Bank, the depositary of the Convention, of the twentieth instrument of ratifica- tion, acceptance or approval.\\n\\n5. The attached text of the Convention in the English, French and Spanish languages has been deposited in the archives of the Bank, as depositary, and is open for signature.\\n\\nII\\n\\n6. The question of the desirability and practicability of establish- ing institutional facilities, sponsored by the Bank, for the settlement through conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between States and foreign investors was first placed before the Board of Gover- nors of the Bank at its Seventeenth Annual Meeting, held in Washing- ton, D.C. in September 1962. At that Meeting the Board of Governors, by Resolution No. 174, adopted on September 18, 1962, requested the Executive Directors to study the question.\\n\\n7. After a series of informal discussions on the basis of working papers prepared by the staff of the Bank, the Executive Directors decided that the Bank should convene consultative meetings of legal experts designated by member governments to consider the subject in greater detail. The consultative meetings were held on a regional basis in Addis Ababa (December 16-20, 1963), Santiago de Chile (February 3-7, 1964), Geneva (February 17-21, 1964) and Bangkok (April 27-May 1, 1964), with the administrative assistance of the United Nations Eco- nomic Commissions and the European Office of the United Nations, and took as the basis for discussion a Preliminary Draft of a Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States prepared by the staff of the Bank in the light of the discus- sions of the Executive Directors and the views of governments. The meetings were attended by legal experts from 86 countries. 8. In the light of the preparatory work and of the views expressed at the consultative meetings, the Executive Directors reported to the Board of Governors at its Nineteenth Annual Meeting in Tokyo, in Sep- tember 1964, that it would be desirable to establish the institutional facilities envisaged, and to do so within the framework of an inter-gov-\\n\\n39\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\no n\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nR e p o r t\\n\\no f\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e\\n\\nD i r e c t o r s\\n\\nernmental agreement. The Board of Governors adopted the Resolution set forth in paragraph 1 of this Report, whereupon the Executive Direc- tors undertook the formulation of the present Convention. With a view to arriving at a text which could be accepted by the largest possible number of governments, the Bank invited its members to designate rep- resentatives to a Legal Committee which would assist the Executive Directors in their task. This Committee met in Washington from November 23 through December 11, 1964, and the Executive Directors gratefully acknowledge the valuable advice they received from the rep- resentatives of the 61 member countries who served on the Committee.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nIn submitting the attached Convention to governments, the Executive Directors are prompted by the desire to strengthen the part- nership between countries in the cause of economic development. The creation of an institution designed to facilitate the settlement of dis- putes between States and foreign investors can be a major step toward promoting an atmosphere of mutual confidence and thus stimulating a larger flow of private international capital into those countries which wish to attract it.\\n\\n9.\\n\\n10. The Executive Directors recognize that investment disputes are as a rule settled through administrative, judicial or arbitral procedures available under the laws of the country in which the investment con- cerned is made. However, experience shows that disputes may arise which the parties wish to settle by other methods; and investment agreements entered into in recent years show that both States and investors frequently consider that it is in their mutual interest to agree to resort to international methods of settlement.\\n\\n11. The present Convention would offer international methods of settlement designed to take account of the special characteristics of the disputes covered, as well as of the parties to whom it would apply. It would provide facilities for conciliation and arbitration by specially qualified persons of independent judgment carried out according to rules known and accepted in advance by the parties concerned. In par- ticular, it would ensure that once a government or investor had given consent to conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Centre, such consent could not be unilaterally withdrawn.\\n\\n12. The Executive Directors believe that private capital will con- tinue to flow to countries offering a favorable climate for attractive and sound investments, even if such countries did not become parties to the Convention or, having joined, did not make use of the facilities of the Centre. On the other hand, adherence to the Convention by a country would provide additional inducement and stimulate a larger flow of private international investment into its territories, which is the pri- mary purpose of the Convention. 40\\n\\n13. While the broad objective of the Convention is to encourage a larger flow of private international investment, the provisions of the Convention maintain a careful balance between the interests of investors and those of host States. Moreover, the Convention permits the institution of proceedings by host States as well as by investors and the Executive Directors have constantly had in mind that the provisions of the Convention should be equally adapted to the requirements of both cases.\\n\\n14. The provisions of the attached Convention are for the most part self-explanatory. Brief comment on a few principal features may, however, be useful to member governments in their consideration of the Convention. IV The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n15. The Convention establishes the International Centre for Settle- ment of Investment Disputes as an autonomous international institu- tion (Articles 18-24). The purpose of the Centre is “to provide facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes * * *” (Article 1(2)). The Centre will not itself engage in conciliation or arbitration activities. This will be the task of Conciliation Commissions and Arbi- tral Tribunals constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\\n\\n16. As sponsor of the establishment of the institution the Bank will provide the Centre with premises for its seat (Article 2) and, pursuant to arrangements between the two institutions, with other administra- tive facilities and services (Article 6(d)).\\n\\n17. With respect to the financing of the Centre (Article 17), the Executive Directors have decided that the Bank should be prepared to provide the Centre with office accommodation free of charge as long as the Centre has its seat at the Bank’s headquarters and to underwrite, within reasonable limits, the basic overhead expenditure of the Centre for a period of years to be determined after the Centre is established.\\n\\n18. Simplicity and economy consistent with the efficient discharge of the functions of the Centre characterize its structure. The organs of the Centre are the Administrative Council (Articles 4-8) and the Secre- tariat (Article 9-11). The Administrative Council will be composed of one representative of each Contracting State, serving without remuner- ation from the Centre. Each member of the Council casts one vote and matters before the Council are decided by a majority of the votes cast unless a different majority is required by the Convention. The President 41\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\no n\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nR e p o r t\\n\\no f\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e\\n\\nD i r e c t o r s\\n\\nof the Bank will serve ex officio as the Council’s Chairman but will have no vote. The Secretariat will consist of a Secretary-General, one or more Deputy Secretaries-General and staff. In the interest of flexibility the Convention provides for the possibility of there being more than one Deputy Secretary-General, but the Executive Directors do not now foresee a need for more than one or two full time high officials of the Centre. Article 10, which requires that the Secretary-General and any Deputy Secretary-General be elected by the Administrative Council by a majority of two-thirds of its members, on the nomination of the Chairman, limits their terms of office to a period not exceeding six years and permits their re-election. The Executive Directors believe that the initial election, which will take place shortly after the Convention will have come into force, should be for a short term so as not to deprive the States which ratify the Convention after its entry into force of the pos- sibility of participating in the selection of the high officials of the Centre. Article 10 also limits the extent to which these officials may engage in activities other than their official functions.\\n\\nFunctions of the Administrative Council\\n\\n19. The principal functions of the Administrative Council are the election of the Secretary-General and any Deputy Secretary-General, the adoption of the budget of the Centre and the adoption of adminis- trative and financial regulations, rules governing the institution of pro- ceedings and rules of procedure for conciliation and arbitration proceedings. Action on all these matters requires a majority of two- thirds of the members of the Council. Functions of the Secretary-General\\n\\n20. The Convention requires the Secretary-General to perform a variety of administrative functions as legal representative, registrar and principal officer of the Centre (Articles 7(1), 11, 16(3), 25(4), 28, 36, 49(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(2), 59, 60(1), 63(b) and 65). In addition, the Secretary-General is given the power to refuse registration of a request for conciliation proceedings or arbitration proceedings, and thereby to prevent the institution of such proceedings, if on the basis of the information furnished by the applicant he finds that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre (Article 28(3) and 36(3)). The Secretary-General is given this limited power to “screen” requests for conciliation or arbitration proceedings with a view to avoiding the embarrassment to a party (particularly a State) which might result from the institution of proceedings against it in a dispute which it had not consented to submit to the Centre, as well as the pos- sibility that the machinery of the Centre would be set in motion in cases which for other reasons were obviously outside the jurisdiction of the 42\\n\\nCentre e.g., because either the applicant or the other party was not eli- gible to be a party in proceedings under the Convention.\\n\\nThe Panels\\n\\n21. Article 3 requires the Centre to maintain a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel of Arbitrators, while Articles 12-16 outline the manner and terms of designation of Panel members. In particular, Article 14(1) seeks to ensure that Panel members will possess a high degree of com- petence and be capable of exercising independent judgment. In keeping with the essentially flexible character of the proceedings, the Conven- tion permits the parties to appoint conciliators and arbitrators from outside the Panels but requires (Articles 31(2) and 40(2)) that such appointees possess the qualities stated in Article 14(1). The Chairman, when called upon to appoint a conciliator or arbitrator pursuant to Article 30 or 38, is restricted in his choice to Panel members. V Jurisdiction of the Centre\\n\\n22. The term “jurisdiction of the Centre” is used in the Convention as a convenient expression to mean the limits within which the provi- sions of the Convention will apply and the facilities of the Centre will be available for conciliation and arbitration proceedings. The jurisdic- tion of the Centre is dealt with in Chapter II of the Convention (Arti- cles 25-27). Consent\\n\\n23. Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre. Consent to jurisdiction must be in writing and once given cannot be withdrawn unilaterally (Article 25(1)).\\n\\n24. Consent of the parties must exist when the Centre is seized (Articles 28(3) and 36(3)) but the Convention does not otherwise spec- ify the time at which consent should be given. Consent may be given, for example, in a clause included in an investment agreement, provid- ing for the submission to the Centre of future disputes arising out of that agreement, or in a compromis regarding a dispute which has already arisen. Nor does the Convention require that the consent of both par- ties be expressed in a single instrument. Thus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.\\n\\n25. While consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dis- pute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Con-\\n\\n43\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\no n\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nR e p o r t\\n\\no f\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e\\n\\nD i r e c t o r s\\n\\nvention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.\\n\\nNature of the Dispute\\n\\n26. Article 25(1) requires that the dispute must be a “legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.” The expression “legal dispute” has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dis- pute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation.\\n\\n27. No attempt was made to define the term “investment” given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not con- sider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)). Parties to the Dispute\\n\\n28. For a dispute to be within the jurisdiction of the Centre one of the parties must be a Contracting State (or a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State) and the other party must be a “national of another Contracting State.” The latter term as defined in paragraph (2) of Article 25 covers both natural persons and juridical persons.\\n\\n29. It should be noted that under clause (a) of Article 25(2) a nat- ural person who was a national of the State party to the dispute would not be eligible to be a party in proceedings under the auspices of the Centre, even if at the same time he had the nationality of another State. This ineligibility is absolute and cannot be cured even if the State party to the dispute had given its consent.\\n\\n30. Clause (b) of Article 25(2), which deals with juridical persons, is more flexible. A juridical person which had the nationality of the State party to the dispute would be eligible to be a party to proceedings under the auspices of the Centre if that State had agreed to treat it as a national of another Contracting State because of foreign control. Notifications by Contracting States\\n\\n31. While no conciliation or arbitration proceedings could be brought against a Contracting State without its consent and while no Contracting State is under any obligation to give its consent to such proceedings, it was nevertheless felt that adherence to the Convention might be interpreted as holding out an expectation that Contracting States would give favorable consideration to requests by investors for the submission of a dispute to the Centre. It was pointed out in that connection that there might be classes of investment disputes which 44\\n\\ngovernments would consider unsuitable for submission to the Centre or which, under their own law, they were not permitted to submit to the Centre. In order to avoid any risk of misunderstanding on this score, Article 25(4) expressly permits Contracting States to make known to the Centre in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre. The provi- sion makes clear that a statement by a Contracting State that it would consider submitting a certain class of dispute to the Centre would serve for purposes of information only and would not constitute the consent required to give the Centre jurisdiction. Of course, a statement exclud- ing certain classes of disputes from consideration would not constitute a reservation to the Convention.\\n\\nArbitration as Exclusive Remedy\\n\\n32. It may be presumed that when a State and an investor agree to have recourse to arbitration, and do not reserve the right to have recourse to other remedies or require the prior exhaustion of other remedies, the intention of the parties is to have recourse to arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. This rule of interpretation is embodied in the first sentence of Article 26. In order to make clear that it was not intended thereby to modify the rules of international law regarding the exhaustion of local remedies, the second sentence explic- itly recognizes the right of a State to require the prior exhaustion of local remedies. Claims by the Investor’s State\\n\\n33. When a host State consents to the submission of a dispute with an investor to the Centre, thereby giving the investor direct access to an international jurisdiction, the investor should not be in a position to ask his State to espouse his case and that State should not be permitted to do so. Accordingly, Article 27 expressly prohibits a Contracting State from giving diplomatic protection, or bringing an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Con- tracting State have consented to submit, or have submitted, to arbitra- tion under the Convention, unless the State party to the dispute fails to honor the award rendered in that dispute. VI Proceedings under the Convention\\n\\nInstitution of Proceedings\\n\\n34. Proceedings are instituted by means of a request addressed to the Secretary-General (Articles 28 and 36). After registration of the request the Conciliation Commission or Arbitral Tribunal, as the case\\n\\n45\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\no n\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nR e p o r t\\n\\no f\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e\\n\\nD i r e c t o r s\\n\\nmay be, will be constituted. Reference is made to paragraph 20 above on the power of the Secretary-General to refuse registration.\\n\\nConstitution of Conciliation Commissions and Arbitral Tribunals\\n\\n35. Although the Convention leaves the parties a large measure of freedom as regards the constitution of Commissions and Tribunals, it assures that a lack of agreement between the parties on these matters or the unwillingness of a party to cooperate will not frustrate proceedings (Articles 29-30 and 37-38, respectively).\\n\\n36. Mention has already been made of the fact that the parties are free to appoint conciliators and arbitrators from outside the Panels (see paragraph 21 above). While the Convention does not restrict the appointment of conciliators with reference to nationality, Article 39 lays down the rule that the majority of the members of an Arbitral Tribunal should not be nationals of the State party to the dispute or of the State whose national is a party to the dispute. This rule is likely to have the effect of excluding persons having these nationalities from serving on a Tribunal composed of not more than three members. However, the rule will not apply where each and every arbitrator on the Tribunal has been appointed by agreement of the parties. Conciliation Proceedings; Powers and Functions of Arbitral Tribunals\\n\\n37. In general, the provisions of Articles 32-35 dealing with concil- iation proceedings and of Articles 41-49, dealing with the powers and functions of Arbitral Tribunals and awards rendered by such Tribunals, are self-explanatory. The differences between the two sets of provisions reflect the basic distinction between the process of conciliation which seeks to bring the parties to agreement and that of arbitration which aims at a binding determination of the dispute by the Tribunal.\\n\\n38. Article 41 reiterates the well-established principle that interna- tional tribunals are to be the judges of their own competence and Arti- cle 32 applies the same principle to Conciliation Commissions. It is to be noted in this connection that the power of the Secretary-General to refuse registration of a request for conciliation or arbitration (see para- graph 20 above) is so narrowly defined as not to encroach on the pre- rogative of Commissions and Tribunals to determine their own competence and, on the other hand, that registration of a request by the Secretary-General does not, of course, preclude a Commission or Tri- bunal from finding that the dispute is outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\\n\\n39. In keeping with the consensual character of proceedings under the Convention, the parties to conciliation or arbitration proceedings\\n\\n46\\n\\nmay agree on the rules of procedure which will apply in those proceed- ings. However, if or to the extent that they have not so agreed the Con- ciliation Rules and Arbitration Rules adopted by the Administrative Council will apply (Articles 33 and 44).\\n\\n40. Under the Convention an Arbitral Tribunal is required to apply the law agreed by the parties. Failing such agreement, the Tribunal must apply the law of the State party to the dispute (unless that law calls for the application of some other law), as well as such rules of international law as may be applicable. The term “international law” as used in this context should be understood in the sense given to it by Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, allowance being made for the fact that Article 38 was designed to apply to inter-State disputes.1 Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards\\n\\n41. Article 53 declares that the parties are bound by the award and that it shall not be subject to appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the Convention. The remedies provided for are revision (Article 51) and annulment (Article 52). In addition, a party may ask a Tribunal which omitted to decide any question submitted to it, to sup- plement its award (Article 49(2)) and may request interpretation of the award (Article 50).\\n\\n42. Subject to any stay of enforcement in connection with any of the above proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Con- vention, the parties are obliged to abide by and comply with the award and Article 54 requires every Contracting State to recognize the award as binding and to enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by the award as if it were a final decision of a domestic court. Because of the different legal techniques followed in common law and civil law juris- dictions and the different judicial systems found in unitary and federal or other non-unitary States, Article 54 does not prescribe any particu- lar method to be followed in its domestic implementation, but requires each Contracting State to meet the requirements of the Article in accor- dance with its own legal system.\\n\\n43. The doctrine of sovereign immunity may prevent the forced execution in a State of judgments obtained against foreign States or\\n\\n1 Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice reads as follows: “1. The Court, whose function it is to decide in accordance with international law\\n\\nsuch disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: a. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules\\n\\nexpressly recognized by the contesting states;\\n\\nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; d. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.”\\n\\n47\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\no n\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nC o n v e n t i o n\\n\\nR e p o r t\\n\\no f\\n\\nt h e\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e\\n\\nD i r e c t o r s\\n\\nagainst the State in which execution is sought. Article 54 requires Con- tracting States to equate an award rendered pursuant to the Convention with a final judgment of its own courts. It does not require them to go beyond that and to undertake forced execution of awards rendered pur- suant to the Convention in cases in which final judgments could not be executed. In order to leave no doubt on this point Article 55 provides that nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.\\n\\nVII Place of Proceedings\\n\\n44. In dealing with proceedings away from the Centre, Article 63 provides that proceedings may be held, if the parties so agree, at the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration or of any other appropriate institution with which the Centre may enter into arrangements for that purpose. These arrangements are likely to vary with the type of institu- tion and to range from merely making premises available for the pro- ceedings to the provision of complete secretariat services. VIII Disputes Between Contracting States\\n\\n45. Article 64 confers on the International Court of Justice juris- diction over disputes between Contracting States regarding the inter- pretation or application of the Convention which are not settled by negotiation and which the parties do not agree to settle by other meth- ods. While the provision is couched in general terms, it must be read in the context of the Convention as a whole. Specifically, the provision does not confer jurisdiction on the Court to review the decision of a Conciliation Commission or Arbitral Tribunal as to its competence with respect to any dispute before it. Nor does it empower a State to institute proceedings before the Court in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State have consented to submit or have submitted to arbitration, since such proceedings would contra- vene the provisions of Article 27, unless the other Contracting State had failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in that dispute. IX Entry into Force\\n\\n46. The Convention is open for signature on behalf of States mem- bers of the Bank. It will also be open for signature on behalf of any other State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Jus- tice and which the Administrative Council, by a vote of two-thirds of its\\n\\n48\\n\\nmembers, shall have invited to sign. No time limit has been prescribed for signature. Signature is required both of States joining before the Convention enters into force and those joining thereafter (Article 67). The Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by the signatory States in accordance with their constitutional procedures (Article 68). As already stated, the Convention will enter into force upon the deposit of the twentieth instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval.\\n\\n49\\n\\ns r o t c e r i D\\n\\ne v i t u c e x E\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt r o p e R\\n\\nn o i t n e v n o C\\n\\ne h t\\n\\nn o\\n\\nADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REGULATIONS\\n\\n51\\n\\nd n a\\n\\ne v i t a r t s i n i m d A\\n\\ns n o i t a l u g e R\\n\\nl a i c n a n i F\\n\\nChapter Regulation\\n\\nI\\n\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\\n\\nII\\n\\n8\\n\\n9 10 11 12 13\\n\\nIII\\n\\n14 15 16 17 18 19\\n\\nIV\\n\\n20 21 22\\n\\nV\\n\\n23 24 25 26\\n\\nADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REGULATIONS\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nProcedures of the Administrative Council Date and Place of the Annual Meeting . . . . . . .

All advances and charges shall be payable, at the place and in the currencies specified by the Secretary-General, as soon as a request for payment is made by him. If the amounts requested are not paid in full within 30 days, then the Secretary-General shall inform both parties of the default and give an opportunity to either of them to make the required payment. At any time 15 days after such information is sent by the Secre-\\n\\n61\\n\\nd n a\\n\\ne v i t a r t s i n i m d A\\n\\ns n o i t a l u g e R\\n\\nl a i c n a n i F\\n\\nF i n a n c i a l\\n\\nR e g u l a t i o n s\\n\\nA d m i n i s t r a t i v e\\n\\na n d\\n\\ntary-General, he may move that the Commission or Tri- bunal stay the proceeding, if by the date of such motion any part of the required payment is still outstanding. If any proceeding is stayed for non-payment for a consecutive period in excess of six months, the Secretary-General may, after notice to and as far as possible in consultation with the parties, move that the competent body discontinue the proceeding;\\n\\n(e) in the event that an application for annulment of an award is registered, the above provisions of this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis, except that the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the con- stitution of the Committee, and without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.\\n\\nRegulation 15 Special Services to Parties\\n\\n(1) The Centre shall only perform any special service for a party in connection with a proceeding (for example, the provision of transla- tions or copies) if the party shall in advance have deposited an amount sufficient to cover the charge for such service.\\n\\n(2) Charges for special services shall normally be based on a sched- ule of fees to be promulgated from time to time by the Secretary-Gen- eral and communicated by him to all Contracting States as well as to the parties to all pending proceedings.\\n\\nRegulation 16 Fee for Lodging Requests\\n\\nThe party or parties (if a request is made jointly) wishing to insti- tute a conciliation or arbitration proceeding, requesting a supplemen- interpretation, revision or tary decision to, or the rectification, annulment of an arbitral award, or requesting resubmission of a dispute to a new Tribunal after the annulment of an arbitral award, shall pay to the Centre a non-refundable fee determined from time to time by the Secretary-General.\\n\\n62\\n\\nRegulation 17 The Budget\\n\\n(1) The fiscal year of the Centre shall run from July 1 of each year\\n\\nto June 30 of the following year.\\n\\n(2) Before the end of each fiscal year the Secretary-General shall prepare and submit, for adoption by the Administrative Council at its next Annual Meeting and in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the Convention, a budget for the following fiscal year. This budget is to indicate the expected expenditures of the Centre (excepting those to be incurred on a reimbursable basis) and the expected revenues (except- ing reimbursements).\\n\\n(3) If, during the course of a fiscal year, the Secretary-General determines that the expected expenditures will exceed those authorized in the budget, or if he should wish to incur expenditures not previously authorized, he shall, in consultation with the Chairman, prepare a sup- plementary budget, which he shall submit to the Administrative Coun- cil for adoption, either at the Annual Meeting or at any other meeting, or in accordance with Regulation 7(3).\\n\\n(4) The adoption of a budget constitutes authority for the Secre- tary-General to make expenditures and incur obligations for the pur- poses and within the limits specified in the budget. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrative Council, the Secretary-General may exceed the amount specified for any given budget item, provided that the total amount of the budget is not exceeded.\\n\\n(5) Pending the adoption of the budget by the Administrative Council, the Secretary-General may incur expenditures for the pur- poses and within the limits specified in the budget he submitted to the Council, up to one quarter of the amount authorized to be expended in the previous fiscal year but in no event exceeding the amount that the Bank has agreed to make available for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nRegulation 18 Assessment of Contributions\\n\\n(1) Any excess of expected expenditures over expected revenues shall be assessed on the Contracting States. Each State that is not a member of the Bank shall be assessed a fraction of the total assessment equal to the fraction of the budget of the International Court of Justice that it would have to bear if that budget were divided only among the Contracting States in proportion to the then current scale of contribu- tions applicable to the budget of the Court; the balance of the total assessment shall be divided among the Contracting States that are members of the Bank in proportion to their respective subscription to the capital stock of the Bank. The assessments shall be calculated by the\\n\\n63\\n\\nd n a\\n\\ne v i t a r t s i n i m d A\\n\\ns n o i t a l u g e R\\n\\nl a i c n a n i F\\n\\nF i n a n c i a l\\n\\nR e g u l a t i o n s\\n\\nA d m i n i s t r a t i v e\\n\\na n d\\n\\nSecretary-General immediately after the adoption of the annual budget, on the basis of the then current membership of the Centre, and shall be promptly communicated to all Contracting States. The assessments shall be payable as soon as they are thus communicated.\\n\\n(2) On the adoption of a supplementary budget, the Secretary-Gen- eral shall immediately calculate supplementary assessments, which shall be payable as soon as they are communicated to the Contracting States. (3) A State which is party to the Convention during any part of a fiscal year shall be assessed for the entire fiscal year.

A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter- memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder—unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\\n\\n(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\\n\\n(3) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection.\\n\\n(4) The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further proce- dures relating to the objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be oral. It may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\\n\\n(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly with- out legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objec- tion. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\\n\\n(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the juris- diction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\\n\\n119\\n\\ns e l u R\\n\\nn o i t a r t i b r A\\n\\nA r b i t r a t i o n\\n\\nR u l e s\\n\\nRule 42 Default\\n\\n(1) If a party (in this Rule called the “defaulting party”) fails to appear or to present its case at any stage of the proceeding, the other party may, at any time prior to the discontinuance of the proceeding, request the Tribunal to deal with the questions submitted to it and to render an award.\\n\\n(2) The Tribunal shall promptly notify the defaulting party of such a request. Unless it is satisfied that that party does not intend to appear or to present its case in the proceeding, it shall, at the same time, grant a period of grace and to this end:\\n\\n(a) if that party had failed to file a pleading or any other instru- ment within the time limit fixed therefor, fix a new time limit for its filing; or\\n\\n(b) if that party had failed to appear or present its case at a\\n\\nhearing, fix a new date for the hearing.\\n\\nThe period of grace shall not, without the consent of the other\\n\\nparty, exceed 60 days.\\n\\n(3) After the expiration of the period of grace or when, in accor- dance with paragraph (2), no such period is granted, the Tribunal shall resume the consideration of the dispute. Failure of the defaulting party to appear or to present its case shall not be deemed an admission of the assertions made by the other party.\\n\\n(4) The Tribunal shall examine the jurisdiction of the Centre and its own competence in the dispute and, if it is satisfied, decide whether the submissions made are well-founded in fact and in law. To this end, it may, at any stage of the proceeding, call on the party appearing to file observations, produce evidence or submit oral explanations.\\n\\nRule 43 Settlement and Discontinuance\\n\\n(1) If, before the award is rendered, the parties agree on a settle- ment of the dispute or otherwise to discontinue the proceeding, the Tri- bunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall, at their written request, in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding.\\n\\n(2) If the parties file with the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement and in writing request the Tribunal to embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of its award.\\n\\n120\\n\\nRule 44 Discontinuance at Request of a Party\\n\\nIf a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tri- bunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been consti- tuted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.\\n\\nRule 45 Discontinuance for Failure of Parties to Act\\n\\nIf the parties fail to take any steps in the proceeding during six con- secutive months or such period as they may agree with the approval of the Tribunal, or of the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, they shall be deemed to have discontinued the pro- ceeding and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall, after notice to the parties, in an order take note of the discontinuance.\\n\\nChapter VI The Award\\n\\nRule 46 Preparation of the Award\\n\\nThe award (including any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure of the proceeding.

Conflict of interest.\\n\\n(1) A mediator shall disclose to the parties to the mediation any matter\\n\\nwhich could be regarded as a conflict of interest.\\n\\n(2) The mediator shall disclose the conflict of interest as soon as the\\n\\nconflict of interest arises which could be prior to or during the mediation.\\n\\n(3) A conflict of interest may be apparent, potential or actual.\\n\\n(4) A mediator shall not act or continue to act in mediation where he or she has a conflict of interest unless all the parties specifically acknowledge the\\n\\n514\\n\\ndisclosure and agree in writing to the mediator acting or continuing to act as mediator. 5. A mediator must refrain from giving legal advice or counseling during the mediation process.\\n\\nSeparation of mediation from legal advice and counseling.\\n\\n6.

Other functions like weightsLumley provide different weighting schemes, such as truncated and smoothed weights, which are useful in certain applications. In econometric analyses, these functions are used to compute partial t-tests for assessing the significance of a parameter. The choice of estimator depends on the presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the errors.\n"
